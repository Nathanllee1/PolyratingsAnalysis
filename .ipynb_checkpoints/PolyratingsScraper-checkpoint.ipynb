      "I had Dr. Abel a year ago as a freshman, but PolyRatings did not have her listed yet. I'm happy they updated their professor list so I could share how legit she is at teaching chem. To start off, Chem 124 is the \"weeder\" class for incoming freshmen, and I was absolutely terrible at chem in high school. Therefore, I was dreading taking a college level chem course. As a great suprise, Dr. Abel changed my attitude towards chem for the better with her concise lectures and friendly personality. I understood chem much better with her as a teacher, and she goes out of the way to make sure you understand the course material. She provides many supplemental handouts for practice, plenty of office hours, and even gives an extra assignment towards the end of the quarter to help your grade out (I don't know any other chem professor that does this). In addition, she's a very fair grader and curves the final grades nicely. Suffice it to say, Chem 124/125 is a difficult class to conquer. However, with substantial effort and help from Dr. Abel I was able to not just survive, but get a good grade. I had Dr. Zumwalt for 125 and quickly missed having Dr. Abel for chem. Take her at all costs, even at 8AM.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

Labs are usually fun after an hour and half of nonstop lecturing. lab reports are assigned weekly, some parts of the report can be bs'ed like the conclusion.

      "Everything for this class was straightforward.  Everything you need to know was covered in lecture (book wasn't helpful) and everything gets posted online with study guides and workbook solutions.  It takes alot of studying to get through this class with a good grade, and a good lab partner helps alot, I would definately recommend taking this class with someone you know.  As far as Abel, she's a very nice person, understanding for difficult situations.  She makes some mistakes in presenting the lecture, but she always admits them and is quick to make corrections.  Extremely helpful one-on-one after class or in office hours, you can tell she knows her stuff.  Fair grader, class material is all presented in lecture plus online, what more do you want?  Take Abel!  PS. I had Dr. Neff for 124 and would highly recommend her for 124 or 125 as well.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

DO THE WORKBOOKS, a lot of the problems and questions on her exams come straight out of the workbooks.  Also, she likes to give our a lot of supplemental handouts to go with her notes, STAPLE them to the corresponding page in your notes.

Her handwriting was very legible and once she took up the entire board and needed more space, she would wait to make sure everyone had all the information. There were three midterms and a final, all of them were simple as long as you studied. And even if you did worse than you expected, you can go into her office hours and discuss where things went wrong. She's very helpful in her office hours and wants her students to pass.

      "I'm currently taking AERO 300 and am hugely disappointed in Abercromby's teaching ability. Obviously she is just out of industry, so teaching an entry level class might not be the best for her (because she doesn't remember any of the material from when she learned it), but I think she should still be able to put in the extra effort needed to learn the material through and through before teaching a lecture on it. I kid you not, she literally will hold a piece of paper in front of her face with the notes on it while she copies them down onto the whiteboard for us to write down. The only problem with that is that most of the time she doesn't even copy the notes correctly, so you're always sitting there trying to decipher what she just wrote. Of course, she's trying to do the same, so it's just a bad combination. If you can, take marshall for this class over abercromby, but honestly, both teachers aren't the greatest. the only reason i suggest marshall is because he has been teaching the class for awhile, so at least he knows the material. (i know this because marshall taught our class for a week when abercromby was gone getting her picture taken with the new shuttle. why that takes a week i do not know...) \r\n",

      " Abercromby seems to be getting a bad rep from the young Aeros via AERO 300. Everyone should know that she only has one quarter of teaching under her belt (Spring 2009), so lets give her a break. It was also her first time teaching AERO 451, Spaceflight Dynamics I, in the Spring and while I wasn\\'t disappointed with her teaching style, I could easily see how some would be. \r\n",
      " Let\\'s start with the positives: she has a sense of humor, her help in office hours is invaluable and she\\'s a consistent and fair grader. Negatives: relative inexperience (this will likely fade), is very much a \\\"regurgitator\\\", that is, she basically taught us right out of the Orbtial Mechanics book by Curtis, and she does occasionally make mistakes. She provides an example every time she explains a new concept, which is really helpful. Usually the example comes from the text, or perhaps it\\'s an unassigned HW problem, but to me it didn\\'t matter. It helped a lot to have her explain the concept and then do some kind of example. \r\n",
      " Anyways, I don\\'t find fault in her inexperience...she\\'ll get the hang of things without a doubt. Teaching us out of the book...that\\'s not so bad either, because Curtis is a good book and whenever she felt Curtis was wrong, she wouldn\\'t hesitate to say so and provide her own insight. The mistakes in class come from being under-prepared in my honest opinion. I think that problem will likely be remedied in future classes where she has past experience to build upon.\r\n",
      " If you dislike being taught out of the book and don\\'t want to go to lecture and would rather read and just learn from the book...you could probably do that in this case, at least, that was my experience. \r\n",
      " The grading structure was split up into HW/1 Midterm/Project/Final. The homework was probably the most important part of the class because it prepared you for the midterm (which I did miserably on, but still pulled a B - a testament to her fair grading because I showed improvement), the project and the final. You really learn all of the fundamentals and concepts through the HW, so don\\'t think about not doing it. Also, there is a pretty heavy reliance on the Aero\\'s mortal enemy MATLAB in this course. You could probably scrape by without touching MATLAB, but I don\\'t recommend it. Get friendly with it and write some code. Not only will it make your homework and project easier, but you\\'ll have some good code to use in the future. Abercromby will not hesitate to look at your code if you\\'re having trouble with it either and she will help you debug it line by line if necessary. \r\n",
      " All things considered, I have hope for this woman. I think she\\'ll come into her own and become a very good professor. Just give her a chance. At this point, I think she has more redeeming qualities and potential than anyone else in the department. I do believe she\\'ll be the go to professor for 451 from now on, so you won\\'t have a choice but to take her. You kids looking at your options for 300 should think a bit more carefully, but take what I\\'ve said into consideration - she\\'ll only get better.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "oh dear...where to begin...i was one lost soul in this class. It was really boring and a little too abstract for me. His tests were extremely difficult and his papers were very hard to understand. The final paper which was something about personhood and what defines personal identity was sooooo hard, I have never dedicated that much time to a single assignment but it is what saved my grade. Basically what it comes down to is answering every single question he has or if anything I wouldn't take this class unless your really into philosophy.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Abney is a decent lecture, and is very willing to answre questions. He does provide some nice examples about concepts which are very helpful. My biggest qualm about him though is that his lectures are just about verbatim from the text, thus making it feel like you don't really need to buy the text. On the other hand, I loved the \"How to Think about Weird Things\" text, it was a great way to teach the topic because it related to things we've all heard/seen about, and I like that he is flexible enough to teach from such a book. I reccommend him--just don't expect to use the book much. Oh yeah--tests are fair, just make sure to study for them!</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Professor Abney is awesome! He knows his stuff and he can clarify anything you ask him. I thought this was going to be a boring ge class. And at the beginning of the quarter he started off by making a little comment about not getting paid enough to add students. Well that was just to scare people off. He lightens up quickly and makes subtle jokes that get the class chuckling. He explains things in a step by step fashion, allowing you to piece together the subject matter. He splits up the reading assignments wonderfully, so that they work together to help you learn. I would definitely suggest him for Phil 125 over Speech 125 or Engl 125. The class is a little tough but you enjoy it and get so much more out of it!</div></div></div><br/>\n",

The grade is based on a couple five question quizzes, a midterm, a final, and participation/attendance.  Every question is multiple choice.  The quizzes are super-easy, but the midterm/final are far from easy, they definitely require some scratch paper and hard thinking.  A typical lecture consists of going through a chapter in the text with Dr. Abney while he gives you examples and stuff.  It can be boring at times, but I would recommend going every time because he takes roll and tells you when quizzes will be held.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Abney's first day of class was a bitter one. He does not let anybody crash the class if his roster is full. He does not want to take part in helping out the university and the students get the classes they need. The class consists of the midterm and the final. The midterm is worth 20% and the final 30%. The other 50% of your grade is the final paper on some topic of HIS choice. This was really frustrating to me because I don't give a damn about philosophy and I will never ever use it during my lifetime. So basically when you walk into your final, 80% of your grade is on the line. Attendance and participation don't count diddly in the class. The only nice thing about Abney's class is that he normally lets you out a early and that he knows the material extremely well. Teaching the material he does an okay job at. Take Abney if you go to every single class during the quarter and are already confident in your writing abilities. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

The topics for the written final were able to be emailed to you upon request, but all 3 were very complicated.  He doesn't update your grades at all, and unless you ask, you will not know what you get on written assignments.  The debate is extremely intimidating, and he will tear each side apart equally.  This class is most definitely not an easy GE.  The book he recommends is NOT needed.  All test material is off of slides he posts in class.  Also, he gives you the opportunity to type up class notes for an extra 2% on your total grade in the class, which is honestly a great way to study.  He takes things seriously, and teaches some very confusing topics.  I would suggest taking this GE area online, as this class has been the most challenging GE I have taken thus far.

I found the material rather easy to grasp and could figure out most of what we discussed simply by reading the book.  Attending class still helps because he grades partially on attendence and does an ok job of clearing some stuff up.  All in all, not a hard class even with 16 other units.

Abney didnt seem too interested in student's views- my only complaint. This class not difficult if you just listen and take good notes (drawing pictures helps) Also make sure you don't fall behind; if you don't understand something one day, the next day becomes a lot harder. Overall Abney seemed like a very cool guy. He's really mellow (for whatever reason...) and funny to listen to. If you take him, look into counting how many times he says \"everyone with me\" in a single lecture. Its up there. BUT..The final paper is REALLy hard if you're a flowery writer, Abney apparently hates bullshit which is really difficult to leave out when you're writing a college paper. Stick to the facts (or at least semi-logical arguments) and you will do much better on your paper than i did.

      "When I first read Professor Abney's evaluations on here, I was not excited about class with him. But when I went to his class I was shocked on how well he presented the material and how easy it was to understand. He doesn't test you on anything he doesn't lecture on. His tests are word for word taken from his lectures. You can't miss his class because it is so full of information and when you read the test, if you haven't lost too many brain cells over the course of the quarter, you might actually remember him saying word-for-word, every question. So pay attention, try not to drift off. If you care about philosophy at all--or your grade, he will present it in a manner that you can understand and will not throw shit at you on the test that he didn't talk about. For the papers, which are pretty hard, DO EXACTLY WHAT HE SAYS ON THEM. He gives you an outline and some ideas the first week of class on what he wants from your paper. Write it all down and do it. Then, write your paper soon, if you were paying attention and have done a little research (he gives you websites that he wants you to use) it will take about a half an hour to write the paper. Then, talk to him in office hours, take your paper, have him critique it, because he will tell you exactly what you need to do to get an A. I did this with my last two papers. The first paper--he told us we all could have failed because they were so terribly written. I got an A on both my second and final paper. Abney is a cool guy, if youre \"not with\" him, ask questions, odds are he can clarify... but don't just ask questions because you don't agree with what descarte, berkely, plato, or kant says; he is just teaching the class, those are not his opinions. Go in with an open mind and try to get over the monotone-ness of Abney, and this class won't be hard at all.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

He presents the material very clearly, so much so that reading the texts isn't even required. Just go to class and take good notes. I got a B on the first midterm, B on the first paper but ended up with a C in the class, i did not have to put in much effort here. If you pay attention in class and really study for the tests you'll get a B no prob. I recommend Abney.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "I was very impressed with professor Abney.  He was extremely good at getting his points across.  HIs lectures were so imformative that reading the books were totally unnessecary.  He made things very easy to understand.  His class consisted of four mini essays, each which was given full credit as long as you did them and turned them, a midterm, a final, and a final paper.  His tests are not too difficult, he is however a pretty strict grader when it comes to essays.  I had him for a 2 hour class twice a week, and we always got out 30 minutes early.

      "Professor Abney did an excellent job at clarifying the reading material -- especially since the text was often difficult to understand. His lectures were well organized and extremely clear. Questions were often answered with examples and open class discussion of the selected texts were also very helpful. However, feedback on the assigned microthemes was not complete enough to be prepared for the final paper, though professor Abney did begin to elaborate on his feedback later in the course. I would definitely suggest any of professor Abney's courses to those interested in philosophy. Reading for 231 isn't absolutely necessary, though it does help to even further understand the several theories discussed in the course. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

The concepts were cool if you had the time to sit down and think about them on your own, but when does anyone have time to do that?

You may approach him with a problem such as, \"I don't understand why A+B=C.\" Abney's response: \"Because B+A=C ..... got it? Are you with me now?\"  This is his typical reponse when he doesn't know the answer.

His topics are complex (i.e. existence of God) but he'll want you to remain somewhat linear in you arguments. Using his instruction outline will help you remain on-topic and receive a decent grade. And if Abney instructs, remember to include your outline at the front of your essay; a lot of students in my class forgot and lost points.    \n",

One very delightful aspect about Abney is that he lectures over everything that you need to know for the tests, quizzes, and essays.  You do not need to read a single page of the assigned textbooks.  There are some tricky questions, so you do need to have a full understanding of the concepts.  This can be accomplished by paying close attention to his class examples.  There are two argumentative essays.  He often gives you one or two arguments to start your essay which completes about half of the essay for you.  He provides other example arguments in class that require simple modification to meet the requirements of the essays.  Also, you can take your arguments to his office hours and he will gladly comment on them and even provide suggestions.  Overall, I found this class to be pretty easy.  I could see how it might be challenging for some, but Abney is not an unfair professor.  Reminder people, this is a university.  The classes tend to be more difficult here than at a junior college.

      "Abney is an interesting professor and I\\'m gonna tell you everything you need to know if you\\'re going to take him. Don\\'t bother reading. All his lectures are is going over the previous night\\'s readings. With that said, there are a few quizzes (10%), a midterm (20%), a final (20%), a group debate (25%), and a final paper (25%). 70% of your grade comes in the last two weeks. The quizzes and tests are all solely based on the lectures (the final exam was, however, much tougher than the midterm...) The paper has no length requirements, but you basically just follow an outline to discuss topics he gives you the first day of class. This may seem like you can get it done early. Nope. Up until the last lecture are topics that you need in order to provide arguments for/against the topic. The group debate is okay. Our group\\'s topic was too ambiguous and then he attacked our argument because we took something the wrong way... Thanks man. You never find out your grades on the final, the final debate, or the final paper because they\\'re all the last week or so of class- and you just end up with whatever you end up with. He makes a big deal about no one going to his office hours until the last 2 weeks of the quarter. Hmmm, I wonder, maybe its because everything is due then and you\\'re not able to complete them until the last week of class! \\\"Are you with me?\\\"\n",

The midterm and quizzes are easy to pass if you go to class and actually listen to his lectures.  He comes off as if he thinks he knows everything at first, but as the class progressed I realized that he was only presenting information about how the philosopher we were learning about would have believed.  So when he says something in a matter of fact manner, it is usually not because it is his own opinion, but rather because that is the opinion of that certain philosopher.  He makes the information fairly easy to understand, especially compared to trying to read and understand on your own.  However, if you ask a question he isn't the best at clarifying and usually says something like \"stay tuned\" because he thinks he will answer it later.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Professor Abney is a very passionate teacher. He teaches several different philosophy classes and is willing to speak to you outside of class or in office hours about any other philisophical topics that you are interested. He has quizzes almost weekly, a midterm, a team debate, and a final. He does not post any information at all online so keep track of the syllabus, quizzes or any other handouts. During class he will put up a slide show that will give out details about the lecture. I would suggest that you bring a laptop if you are a fast at typing or be prepared to write very quickly (There will be a lot of information). I also recommend to attempt to write down everything that is on the slides as well as much as you can from what he verbally lectures. The quizzes and midterm are sometimes worded strangely so you will really have to think about what his questions are asking. The class was very detailed and his tests will be also. I would recommend that you take Abney for the class but be prepared to lots of notes and to study those notes really well. Finally make sure to pay attention to what philosophers believe in what theories. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "I would recommend Abney to someone who's looking for a professor with low workload, low time dedication to class. There is one, peer graded essay per quarter, two non-cumulative tests, several quizzes interspersed between midterms, and final group debate. \n",
      "I would consider this class enjoyable, as Abney makes an effort to contextualize a lot of the material with real life examples, like comparing ethics to fashion design, and he's very open to discussion in class and clarifying questions. The lectures are all covering the reading material and new content, and the reading assignments are lengthy, but not in depth, so you can usually take sparse notes and clarify key terms in class. \n",
      "A downside to his class is that the lectures are very dense and very necessary. He spends every class going over a powerpoint that covers new material, so prudent note taking is crucial. He also doesn't assign reading or study guides, so if you miss the class or don't write something down, it's on you to find it yourself. His attitude can be abrasive and a bit \"holier than thou\" but it fits his position as a philosophy professor. And his office hours can be very helpful as it's much easier for him to explain difficult concepts in a personal way.\n",
      "Summary: Not a difficult class, but it's a responsibility to keep up during lectures. Not much homework. Sometimes very interesting, sometimes fairly dull.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Abney's classes are very difficult. Do not expect a 'cake-walk' GE. His tests are straight from lecture and are not too difficult. Conversely, his writing assignments are extremely challenging. You will be expected to argue for and against complicated subjects such as personhood, the existence of God, and freedom of speech. He wants an articulate, water-proof arguments that is typically no longer than 500 words. He grades you like your a 4th year Philosophy major and talks to you like your a 1st grader. He's very knowledgeable, but also very arrogant. I would only take this class if you really like philosophy and your already both an articulate writer and a strong syllogist. (If you don't know what a syllogist is, you probably shouldn't take this class.) If you do take his class, go to office hours and attend class. Run your papers by him as many times as you can before you turn them in.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

I have never had an issue with a teacher thus far at Cal Poly (I'm a 3rd year), and although the curriculum is obviously hard to master for any non-philosophy major, Abney was the least helpful as well as RUDEST professor I have ever had.  I took the class knowing it would be not be a walk in the park, but it is worse than that.  He expects not only for everybody to be as smart as him but to also agree with him.  He was sharp and cocky in answering just simple questions during class.  I was afraid to raise my hand just to ask how he spelled something on the board. (because I could never read his terrible hand-writing half of the time!) His tests are based on very specific things he said instead of the overall concepts.  I tried to attend his office hours to see how he was outside of lecture, and because I desperately needed help on the papers. I thought this would work with him...NOPE!  Again he had no intent of helping me and was also very harsh and unkind on top of that.

I'd say a laptop for taking notes is almost necessary since there is so much notes to take in this class. His tests are basically all from the notes. I never opened the book once and I highly suggest to not buy it. His examples early on were pretty stupid and annoying but eventually you got the point. If you like lectures and multiple choice tests and a debate then you will get an A in this class. Had low expectations early on but the class turned out pretty good.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

I got an A on the final as well so I was surprised to see that I got a B in the class. Abney grades extremely hard on the debate. My team thought we did well since our argument was valid and strong, despite the fact that we were cross-examined about details of our argument that we thought were not at the heart of the debate and did not have sufficient time to argue when it was our turn. In addition, we spent many hours working on the debate and learned so much about the topic in the process. I was very disappointed to realize that Abney would allow a full letter grade drop for a student who clearly learned and understood bioethics. \n",

      "Abney is an ok lecturer, though somewhat melodramatic and could cover the material in half the time if he condensed it. He posts the lectures online which is nice, and the quizzes are really easy (it's kind of annoying that he made you bring a scantron for 5-question quizzes every other week though). The midterm was multiple choice and straight from the lectures, you just had to study them the night before and you would do fine. We also had to write a paper, but that was an instant A since he didn't actually grade it. For the final he gave us the choice of writing a paper or taking another multiple choice test, and any person with half a brain chose the multiple choice which was easy again. The #1 determinant of your grade, which I suspect sank many people, was that damn debate. He lets you choose what side and what topic your group gets on the first day, which is unfortunate because some topics are much easier than others but you have no idea of that on the first day. Pro tip: 2-3 weeks before your debate, go in with your group to his office hours and present your debate ideas. He will tear them apart, but better it happen in office hours than have him take it out on you for 2 hours in class. That happened to another group and it was honestly very depressing to watch.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

Reviews basic ethics and incorporates them into situations involving biology, healthcare, etc. The required textbook isn't necessary because he's one of the authors; everything he lectures in class is almost word for word from the book.

He's helpful in office hours especially in preparation for the debate at the end of the term. Make sure for the debate that you are prepared to state what's wrong with the opposing side (hint: ITS PROBABLY IN THE SLIDES!). </div></div></div><br/>\n",

Though there was no reading besides the book, which I never read anyway, the essay topic choice was free to the student. He presented the material clearly, and even cancelled class for two days for individual student interviews. Great idea, though it didn't help my grade much. As my essays got more and more boring throughout the quarter, my grade started to improve, but not for long. No tests, just one essay a week, plus two in-class essays (which could be the midterms, but they were worth less than the regular essays).

I'm not even sure he ever graded them.  Basically you have one week to write a paper on a different subject each time.

      "   Kellie Acosta is the GREATEST lab instructor I've ever had for any lab class!!!  She is well prepared before class starts so it makes it easy for a smooth flowing lab.  There is a quiz everyday based 80% on material covered from the previous lab and 20% from the lab the day of the quiz.  Other instructors do not do this, but having a friend in the lab next to mine, these quizes really get you to pre-read and understand your labs both before and after the quizes.  The quizes will help you in the end for the 3 midterms.  Kellie can recognize when students are struggling with a certain area and will explain it and if it happens to be something that she may question, she will find out and get back to the class so they can understand it.  She is very, very approachable when it comes to extra help and comprehension of the material so do go and see her during her office hours.  Kellie extremely loves biology and gets really excited to teach the class all the fascinating things that biology involves.  She likes to see her students get excited like she does.  Before midterms, she gives extra review questions to help you, where as other instructors do not.  When we got our first midterms back, she had the highest class average out of ALL the 151 lab instructors.  She really cares about the students comprehending the materil and not just regurgitating facts.  If you have any choice in lab instructors for the 151 (which by fall 2005 will be cominbed with the present 153, so I do not know if she will still be teaching), YES I RECOMMEND TAKING KELLIE FOR LAB!!!</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Professor Adam is a good teacher, but her lectures are dry, especially early in the morning.  For 214 her class is formatted as 2 lectures and 1 lab.  The lectures are usually an introduction to the course material with the lab being a practical application of it through Excel.  Her tests are fair to the material as she presents it and she allows a handwritten notecard for tests (highly valuable with the amount of formulas in financial accounting)Homework and textbook readings are all online based through Aplia which requires you to rent the online course materials.  While I would recommend Professor Adam over the other teachers that teach 214, she is not helpful when it comes to answering questions which can make the course difficult for those who fall behind.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Professor Adam never really presented anything in the lecture in a way that would even justify taking any notes whatsoever, additionally the subject material is really difficult and complex, and Prof. Adam continually just assumes that everyone will just know all of the accounting terminology, which is completely new to most of the students. The lab is also a very important part of this class, however other teachers teaching this same course do NOT force their students to use excel, which seems logical since having to learn excel at the same time as the actual course material has been very challenging for me and the other students around me.  She additionally doesn't offer too much help in labs preferring her students just \"figure it out\" for the most part. Long story short, if you take this course plan on reading the textbook (which is also poor as it is 100% online) extensively and learning most of what you will out of it, and very little from the teacher. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

This class ended up being one of my easier classes Fall quarter, when at the beginning I thought it would be my hardest. Because it's managerial accounting, the material in itself is inherently hard, but she tries to make it easier for everybody to do well. We get a 4x6 notecard on all the exams (NOT a 3x5 as the review below me states) which is extremely helpful. I was able to put everything I needed on it to get a Cs on the exams and a B on the final.

Professor Adam is really good at reteaching and enforcing material, but this makes it so that when she taught something new, she started in the middle and worked her way up.

Her lectures had no teaching involved because she was just reading off the powerpoint slides ALL the time. And when she tried to teach, she would have these awkward pauses and would draw a blank for a good 10 seconds figuring out what to tell us. Throughout the quarter I walked out of lecture learning nothing most of the time. I felt like I learned more in Lab because the instructors lectured in that class too...luckily I had a good grad student who knew her stuff. As far as the test go, the questions on the test come from previous midterms and Mastering Biology so make sure to go back and look at them. The Lab is hard and is mainly pure memorization. You need to read the lab manual and study the bold terms. Other than that, I would not take Dr. Adams again because she might/thinks she knows her stuff but in the end she doesn\\'t present it well.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

For instance, she include WAYYYY to much information about diversity and taxonomy that students will think they need to learn so it stresses them out. She did this is lab a lot. There would be ridiculous amounts of material that we needed to draw/include in our lab notebooks and, although we thought some stuff we saw was cool, requiring us to draw and learn all of it was waayyy to much to ask. She needs to focus just on the important concepts about each phylum and not go too crazy. SOOO to sum up, she was a nice teacher, field trips were really fun, BUT don't expect this class to be like a normal 4 unit class!

However, Dr. Adams is not an effective professor. She very rarely explains what it on her slides in an understandable way. On multiple occasions she was stared blankly at the powerpoint, then says “well, you guys get this”, before switching to the next slide. She will frequently read off of the figures on the slides saying “dorsal blastopore lip…mesenchyme…invagination”, which means very little to students who are learning this subject for the first time. Her first test was ridiculously easy, then the next one had an 18% drop in the average. She clearly did not realize how ineffective her teaching style was.

The tests consit of \"slide IDs\" where you name an art piece, its medium, artist, etc (there are always only three parts to know). The rest of the test is a mixture of vocab and general info.

She\\'s genuinely interested in and enthusiastic about the subject, her exams are very fair (and easy, if you\\'re good at memorization), and she makes this course really enjoyable, especially if you have any interest in art history.  Like other reviews have said, the exams consist of identifying pieces of artwork (artist, title, and usually era/style), and vocabulary and other details from lecture.  Reading the textbook is obviously helpful but in my experience, not necessary if you study the lecture materials and images extensively.  I used the textbook a few times during the first week of class, never touched it after that, and got an A in the course without much trouble.

Make flashcards with the images you need to know; it really helps. There are no surprises on the exam; she makes it very clear what is on the tests. I would suggest not buying the text unless you are an art major, or you really like art. I used the copy in the library and I never had trouble checking it out. She speaks kind of loudly, I would suggest sitting near the back if you can. Honestly, Adan is amazing and if you get a chance to take her DO IT!  I wish every professor was as organized as she is.

      "Professor Adan is awesome. She's really passionate about what she teaches which makes the lectures more enjoyable than you think they'd be. ART 112 with Adan was very easy, and if you put even a little effort into studying for the tests, you'll come away with an A. Half of each midterm is image identification, the other half is multiple choice about terms, art eras, etc. Make flash cards out of the images that she puts on PolyLearn and the terms from the midterm study guide, and you're guaranteed to pass the test. I highly recommend taking this class to fulfill GE C3 if it's available to you.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Professor Adan is extremely well versed in her subject. Your grade is based off 3 midterms, with the lowest grade being dropped, and a cumulative final. The lectures are slightly boring but if you sit through them and take notes, as well as study the images she puts online, you are guaranteed an A. I would say that besides the four hours in class, I would study the notes/images for one hour a week so the workload is very minimal. I've never had to go to her office hours but she clearly answers any questions in class. Also you don't need to buy the textbook so save yourself a hundred something dollars. I highly recommend this Professor.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Dr. Adan is an incredibly respectable, intelligent, and inspiring woman and professor. My major is heavily science based, so taking a course like this was incredibly fulfilling and refreshing. Dr. Adan takes command when she is lecturing (at 8am) and makes you want to be there. You are so intrigued by how she presents the material, it doesn't feel that early in the morning. She also will tell you that she takes our education at Cal Poly very seriously and I completely respect her for that. I feel that sometimes professors don't realize how even us as students do too take our education seriously. Overall, she will pretty much tell you what she expects of you to do well in the class.

      "Adan is one of my favorite professors at Cal Poly. At this point, I've had a bunch of good teachers at Cal Poly, but Adan far surpasses any of them (maybe besides one other). I've had her for ART 312 in the past, so I know her style of teaching well. Her upper-division art history classes are fairly low-stress classes. She has amazingly comprehensive lectures that are all based around the readings that she assigns for homework. With that said, you don't have to read the textbook to get a good grade in her class. The main benefit of reading the textbook is to gain more detailed understanding of the subject that will ensure an A. A good amount of students have gotten As on their tests without reading a single page of the textbook because her lectures are THAT good. I do suggest that you take notes in class because she doesn't upload lectures on PolyLearn, and usually a couple read-throughs of the notes will set you up nicely for the exams. She doesn't/very rarely assigns homework besides the readings, so your grade is based on the midterm(s) and final. You will generally write a compare essay for the exams and have a section of identifying the artists, titles, and dates of 10-15 art works you study. For this class (311), she had us group up every class session and write a short essay response to a prompt that she puts up on the board, and this ended up being excellent practice for the essays because it was a similar prompt to the essays. She didn't do the in-class writing assignments for my previous 312 class though. \r\n",

      "Yes, it\\'s true that Dr. Adan\\'s lower division classes are simple. She provides study guides that she tests off of almost verbatim. But her upper division classes such as 310, 311, or 312 are much more challenging. Be prepared for constant note-taking and memorizing dates, artists, and titles of artworks. She is a naturally intense person and gives extremely strict first-day lectures about plagiarism, but don\\'t let this put you off. Her lectures are never boring and she is actually an incredibly kind person. If you are interested in art, this class will be like visiting a museum and having an amazing tour guide.

She also records her lectures so you can listen and watch the power points on blackboard. Secondly, she tries to scare you away on the first day of class. She basically says: if you are lazy, don\\'t take this class. She puts every expectation on the table and explains that she is strict. This is true, but hey it\\'s upper division, that\\'s what one would expect. Thirdly, don\\'t let her monotone voice and constant floor pacing annoy you.

      "Pete is an awesome instructor! He makes the material practical and easy to understand, and if you ever want to own a horse or already do, the information you take from this class will be extremely valuable to you. His powerpoints are always on Bb and everything on the test is pulled directly from them. On top of that, for each test he gives a breakdown of how many questions will be on each subject. When he uses a \\\"horse term\\\" he always makes sure everyone knows what it means before continuing. Labs are totally awesome and not difficult at all. There are 2 midterms and a final, and all are detailed but straight-forward, and if you study all of the slides and know the info, you will get an A on each exam.

      "Pete is a great teacher. he takes the time to explain material well, but assumes most people have some background in horses, if you dont, just talk to him at the start of the quarter and he makes sure to try and explain things out better.  He is really open and is always in his office when not teaching and is easy to talk to.  He can be sarcastic though so if you cant handle it you may not like him.  he is very opinionated, but i personally like that.  id rather have a teacher who says something and sticks to it rather than knows nothing.  his tests and quizzes are difficult but he gives study guides which helps and if you go to lecture you will do better because there is a lot of information he says that may show up on a test as well as sometimes he tells you a \"good test question\".  In lab he is good as well tries to give those with little horse experience a chance to do things but it can sometimes seem boring or a lot of standing around. you will learn a lot from his course as long as you have an open mind and listen to him rather than stick with your own ideas about things.  also if you arent satisfied with a grade he is more than happy to see you in his office to talk about it. he is def one of my favorite teachers and a great on as well.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

The only bad thing about the class it the powerpoints are ridiculously long, so in class only write down what he talks about and go back later to look at all the typed crap (most of it he does not make himself- he has TAs do it, so question any information you find weird)</div></div></div><br/>\n",

He's so funny and sweet and helpful and overall a wonderful professor! I struggled with the material but you can get an A or a B if you work hard, even if you don't know much about horses. I hope I can take another class with him soon, all of his lectures and labs are so much fun!

He sometimes assumes that students have prior horse knowledge, so his classes can be more difficult for those without experience with horses. As an instructor, Pete is average-above average. However, I can't recommend him as a good teacher because I find him extremely difficult to get along with. Students without prior horse knowledge often seem to get along with him becomes he comes across as confident and knowledgeable. But since I've had many years of experience with horses, I do not respect Pete's horsemanship. His teaching and training tactics for the horses are ineffective and often confusing. But most importantly, the reason that I do not like Pete is that he is extremely rude, opinionated, and confrontational. He constantly belittles and bullies students. If he makes offhand remarks or acts rude toward you, its best to just laugh it off and let him do what he wants. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

To top it off, after getting horrible grades on the second midterm and final, I somehow get a B in the class to my astonishment.

Agbo \"teaches\" by using examples from the book.  You could read the book and learn the exact same thing, although it is worth showing up to class on the off chance he makes up an example.  All examples are laid step by step and are relatively easy to understand.  They are simplified examples though, and he usually does not explain them.  That is about it, pretend you are watching a video.  DO NOT EVEN THINK OF ASKING HIM A QUESTION.  He will not understand you, then misinterpret the question to something easy to answer and obvious.

      "Im extremely into my EE major, and was very excited to take college EE classes, but Agbo put that energy away. Hes hard to understand, and has a hard time understanding others as well. It seems that hes assigning labs that he has never done before because he cant answer some questions as to why certain things happen. The majority of the class was confused every lab about what to do. He gives quizzes every week BEFORE he lectures (based on lab reading) which only helps the students who already know the material like the back of their hand. Many people in my class failed the quizzes every week, hopefully they turn out fine... The final had more to do with basic EE than the labs and material covered in class.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Dr. Agbo is an enigma to me. I am sure at some point he must have cared - how else could he be a tenured, full professor. However, whenever that time was, it is a time LONG past. Agbo is, without a doubt, one of the WORST professors I have ever had. His lectures are rushed and often time behind the homework assigned. He doesn't seem prepared to teach class, often beginning lecture up to 20 minutes passed the hour. Worse, any example he gives in class is usually a directed example from the textbook COPIED DIRECTLY from the textbook solutions manual IN CLASS!  Worse, he occasionally gets stuck while \"working\" on these example problems, writes the answer on the board, and moves on. He is confrontation to questions he finds as a nuisance, and can be difficult to understand.  All that being said, his lectures are generally garbage. They often won't make sense if they are understandable at all. (He's got a think accent. You'll get used to it quickly, but it sometimes gets difficult to hear him at the back of a classroom or if he mumbles.) It was unsurprising that more than half the class skipped lecture or walked out early from it by the end of the semester. Although I attended lecture, I can honestly say I learned EXCLUSIVELY from the Textbook.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If He has one saving grace, it's that he give \"easy\" exams. As a general rule, you get a one page cheat sheet. If you can do the homework, you can do the exam. JUST DON'T MISS AN EXAM or he might give you one composed of problems ripped from the textbook.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

He tends to take material straight from the book, but what's nice is that he posts all overhead-display notes on BlackBoard.  Weekly homeworks, 2 midterms, and a final are what comprises your grade, and they're really not hard; he allows a 1 page double-sided notesheet for each midterm and 2 or 3 (depending on the class) pages for the final.  Technically you're not supposed to put figures or pictures on them but he doesn't collect them, so if you're good at drawing tiny circuits it's a win-win situation.

      "I took Agbo because I am a transfer student, and there was not another professor teaching this class. I asked around about him, and everyone told me to wait because EE 306 is very fundamental for electronics and he is really bad lecturing. I said to myself, \" well it is only one quarter, and it will not hurt\"  now he is the only one teaching 307..... that is mess up.... I believe the EE department does it intentionally because no one would take his class if there would be another section..... He is just so bad lecturing plus you cannot even understand his accent. I spent the whole quarter reading the book, notes and watching MIT videos (circuits and electronics).......I am just praying he will not teach EE 308 next year; otherwise, i will fail for life......    So if you have the opportunity to avoid this professor  DO IT, he is just so bad that I wonder why he has not got fired yet........ PS: He is the worst professor I ever had......... did I say the worst?   yeah he is so bad...... that almost no one showed up for his lectures.......AVOID his CLASS ; otherwise, you will regret forever.........</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Agbo is a nice guy. A very intelligent guy too. But he is simply incapable of communicating information in lecture. Many people say he is just inept at teaching. In lecture he most certainly is; he merely reads slides that he has copied straight out of the book, adding practically nothing in the form of discussion and showing us an average of one example per week (that is also taken verbatim from the text). But when his lectures are drawing roughly 7 to 9 people (aside from days when we have something due) you start to wonder if his lectures are so low effort because he has stopped caring or he believes students just learn from the book (hint--they have to with Agbo). At this point I mainly come because I feel sorry for him. It seems as if he's a tenured professor who is unable to put forth any conscious effort into teaching. In office hours you can see him put a bit more effort into overcoming student difficulties, though frankly you're still better off just teaching yourself. Regardless, it is a little bit ridiculous that people pay money under the illusion that their professor is actually going to care. Especially at a state university.\r\n",

Lectures are useless as it becomes a kindergarten reading class where he reads his lecture slides of MOSFETS  to you in his soothing voice. I question his qualifications as there were a couple times he couldn't do KVL or KCL equations right when I went into his office hours. He's so dependent on his lecture slides(since that seems to be what he knows best) that the days that the projector wouldn't work, he would spend the entire time trying to fix the projector.

      "Agbo is your typical apathetic EE professor in the department. I am a new student to Cal Poly and this is my first upper division course here, and I have seen instructors from any of my past institutions who conducts the class as such manner. He is an immigrant, so he has a very deep voice, but his enunciation is good, not as exaggerated by certain reviews. The \"tentative\" schedule on the syllabus was no joke, it was really tentative indeed. He would delay delay and delay homework due date just because he could not catch up to his lectures, which was good for the student at first but it was really bad at the end because he crammed all the materials about semiconductor memories in two two lectures. The exams are seriously jokes. If you pay attention to his examples and study his \"solved example\" and \"notes\" posted on BB then you will pass the exam with flying colours. Those were my only study materials, and I passed both both first and second exams with a 91%. If you just need to \"pass\" this class, he's your guy. Otherwise, if you really want to learn the materials and stay within the digital realm, stay away from Agbo! </div></div></div><br/>\n",

Why the eff does this dipshit make the most money in the EE department (except Lorde Overnerd Derrickson)?????!?!?!?!?!? Like how effed in the A is this department? 85% of the time this guy just looks at you and laughs while he doesn't listen to what your questions are, essentially he only exists to talk down to you. His lectures are straight from his slides which are literally screen-grabs from the textbook summaries for equations. Thankfully he is too dumb to realize nobody learns shit in his class except the 3 equations for each transitor; so generally it is pretty easy if you write everything he has every written on the board onto your note sheet. It's funny, the one time someone that wasn't a student sat in one of our lectures (this was in 314), he completely changed his teaching style and did examples!!! fucking guy did 2 examples the entire 306 class. Derrickson if you are reading this I pray for future generations of beautiful college kids that you relegate this guy to EE314, and then promptly delete the class from the curriculum; thus banishing him forever.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

I just want to know when Agbo got his tenure, i want to know the day it happened because i want to know the day his paid retirement started. He won't try for you, he won't teach you, he won't show you a clear path to success, he will hide, under his shield of tenure and coast throughout your quarter with a lack of coordination on his part and you cannot expect anything different because the curves are so needed that if you even show up to office hours and he's not feeling like giving a half hearted dodge to a question you will get on his bad side and you will never pass.  This man is the reason why Cal Poly Electrical Engineers say our department is hard, not because we learn hard material and have experience, our difficulty is not a trophy for us, we tell people this major is hard because of teachers like this man, Agbo, this is my love letter to you, thanks for hurting my love of EE and the damaging the quality of my degree. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

If I would have studied his notes, I would have easily gotten an 'A,' but instead I studied his old midterms, which he changes each quarter, so don't do that.  His tests are questions from his notes!!!  The reason he got upset, like this idiot below me says, is because the kids in his classes don't appreciate his effort as much as they should.  Agbo simply comes from a different understanding of school- he is from Africa and he worked his ass off just to get where he is, so when he sees negligent kids, especially ones that do try to smear him, of course he gets pissed.  If you simply talk to this guy you will see what he is all about.  Don't assume what everyone else says to be true.  Agbo is a good man with a good heart whose small language barriers cause kids to hate him.  Agbo is fair - dont BS him and he wont you.

      "Dr. Agbo is a really smart guy and he has a wide knowledge of many topics in EE. This however doesn't make him the best instructor. I got the impression that he is not very confident in the way he communicates and that he has a chip on his shoulder about it. I don't think that he answer's are questions very well. It's sad that this man knows so much and has such a hard time conveying it. He also is not very organized. This being said, you still have to read the book and study and all that normal stuff for any EE class. A lot of people in this major don't go to his class because they think the teacher isn't up to par or whatever. Guess what..you still gotta go to class. Learn to show some respect for the people who are imparting their knowledge to you, no matter their race, creed, orientation or teaching method. THEY KNOW MORE THAN YOU. WE AREN'T ENGINEERS YET. THEY ARE. GET OVER IT. Back to Agbo: His tests come out of his notes so you really need to take good notes and GO TO CLASS. The text is a good reference but you will not see many test questions (if any) from it. The homework can be a little gnarly but it does help to reinforce the lecture. He also curves a lot. If you are concentrating on communications, I would suggest taking another professor for the class, like Breitenbach. Yes, Breitenbach. Deal with it. If you aren't into commuications, then Agbo is fine. The bottom line is that Agbo teaches a LOT of different courses in EE and it's highly probable that you will have him at least once. Go to EVERY class, do the homework, know your trig identities or put them on the notesheet, and make sure your tests are VERY complete and you'll be fine.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

Honestly, despite being a smart guy, he just seems unenthusiastic about what he's teaching.  Both the midterms and the final are relatively fair and straightforward if you take good notes and practice homework problems.  Agbo isn't the best or worst professor for this class, but since I'm not going into communications anyway, I'd take this prof over Breitenbach any day.  One thing to note is that he doesn't bring his poking stick much around anymore, which he uses to poke at students sleeping in class.

      "This lab is pretty involved, and I was spoiled with a great lecture professor (Braun). As for Agbo, try not to take him if you can help it. His accent makes him very hard to understand, which I would be able to overlook if he was still able to help us. It was almost as if he was never even there in lab (half the time he left to who knows where with no telling when he was going to be back). When he was in lab, he just read articles on the computer. And when a group needed help setting up a circuit or figuring out why it wasn't working, he was unable to help at all. Multiple times that we had problems with our circuits, he tried to justify it with tolerances of chips etc., when our output was CLEARLY not what we should be getting. Other times he would just look at our circuit and say something was wrong but that he doesn't know what and we should start over again. Because of this, we usually had to stay at least another hour (for the later labs) after the three hours allotted. Also, his grader was absolutely terrible - marked many of the lab groups off when there was actually nothing wrong, and failed to write any comments on the labs whatsoever. Nobody had any idea what they were doing wrong and when Agbo was asked, he usually didn't even come up with an answer (but almost always refusing to change the grade). Near the end, he even told us that nobody would be getting 100%'s anymore because there was bound to be something wrong with each and every group's report. Completely ridiculous - avoid at all costs!</div></div></div><br/>\n",

When he got back he didnt even watch them, he just gave everyone the same grade.  This is the low down on this fucking cock lick, Everyone gets a passing grade in the class sence a B- is a %66, but if you want an A forget about it, A- is the best you can possibly get.  There are four tests and three good size papers one of which is the presentation, but dont stress to much he wont even read them anyway. He will hand them out to other groups and have them give you feedback.  His english is terrible, people just look at him and laugh when he laughs because knowone has any idea what the fuck he is saying.

He seems to get flustered when eithe ryou or he doesn't clarly understand something. Indian culture is different from our own so some things that come off as offensive to us are things that he does not mean to be offensive so you have to have an open mind. He left for two weeks in the beginning of the quarter to go to India and left us with a huge project. The problem was, he didn't answer e-mails and there was no way to get a hold of him if we had questions. Then he expected everyone to be clear when we gave the TEAM presentations. Overall, this man has a good heart and really wants his students to do well but he doesn't make it the easiest to do this. Its down right impossible to get an A.

It is hard to fault a professor who is foreign (India) and who really tries to get students' opinions in order to improve on his course, but man alive, I just couldn't take this professor by the end of the quarter.  His class consists of three midterms that are all short essay and relatively not too difficult, a vague paper that is split up into two parts, and a 50 question multiple choice cumulative final that you would do just as well on if you studied for 10 hours or 10 minutes.  He reads power points for 2 hours every class, and occasionally has short group exercises that are incredibly useless and trivial.  The guy has been all over the world teaching and taking more classes to further his understanding of marketing, but he is just not ready to teach in our culture.  His grading is so unbelievably arbitrary.  You will never know what you did wrong or right on tests and papers, he just gives you a score as if he drew it from a hat.  Overall, this class was anything but challenging, you are guaranteed a B and an A is not too tough to obtain either, but I would only take this class if you dont mind wanting to tear your own eyes out every class.

He gives plenty of feedback throughout the quarter in the form of meetings/discussions about your papers, but dont expect to see any actual grades until week 8 or so.

No exaggeration, it was actually 21 pages long. Who does that? And of course no one in their right mind can read, absorb, and memorize all that detail, but then he totally flips out when you ask any question that the BOOK mentions and is outright MEAN. Definitely discourages class participation unknowingly. I didn't get as much out of the class as I had hoped, the exams are easy but they will be harder next quarter (summer/fall) so watch out. A few big papers to write. Uninspiring lectures. It is an easy B, near impossible A, and awful to sit through. That's 446 with Mohan in a nutshell. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "\r\n",
      "First off, his stunning looks and impecable fashion sense. Picture a Joe Pesci like gremlin but with a leather tan. Now throw on a $15 suit from Ebay and a tie from Ross. Kriss Kross wore their clothes backwards, Bon Jovi had torn jeans and Michael Jackson had one glove . . .all fashion icons have a signature trait. Mohan's is pulling his suit pants up to just below his pecs and then buying a belt 8 sizes too big for his waist. After fastening the belt 9 holes deep he lets the excess belt flap in the wind. Now you may think the popped collar or the aviator sunglasses are fashion statements but none of you had the forsight or the balls to wear the extra large belt. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lets move on to the strut, much can said about a man by the way he walks. Mohan hardly even walks, it is more of a glide with his gut thrusted out with the slight shuffle of his feet. This can only be pulled off by a man with supreme confidence and style . . .Play on playa. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On to his classroom etiquite . . . if you are lucky enough to enter the light and the way that is a mohan classroom you won't forget it. Mohan applies the rare technique of pop culture expertise (look for J Lo and Britney references) along with American custom mishaps (he will often call a male student \"mam\" or a female student \"sir\") then plays it off with this cackle of laughter that can best be described as one student said above like stepping on a turtle. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are no boundaries with Mohan, my classmates and I soon discovered this and altered our questions from general marketing questions to questions about mohan's family (the sacred agrawals) and alcohol, all of which he answered the best he could. We tried to get him to go downtown with us but being the true gentelmen he is he passed. Mohan lives out loud and loves unconditionally. He invited me to Vegas with him (which would have been epic but I passed), wore a t-shirt over his suit with his face on it that said \"You can't have MO with out the Han\" or something like that and threw a pizza party for us on our last day of class (just like in third grade!) all in one quarter. . . .and that is just the tip of the iceberg. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You can tell how much he cares for his students when he gives his farwell speech on the last day of class. He tears up like the fragile girl in elementry school that gets blind sided during a game of dodgeball. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Words of advice for a prospective mohan disciple: \r\n",
      "1) Don't show up late or else he will make you his personal pinata. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2) If he offers you something (like pizza) don't turn it down, I think it is offensive from where he comes from. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3) When he calls on you just start talking and look for the mohan sign of acceptance. This is defined by mohan stopping his forward like moonwalk across the class and then he turns to face you. He will cross his arms and start shaking his head tenaciously like a bobble head. Once you are here you are golden . .just keep talking. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I don't think Mohan is even at Cal Poly anymore which is an absoulte shame but if you have the chance to study abroad . . .Go to India and find this man and take his class. He is a frickin banshee . . .You can't stop Mohan, you can only hope to contain him!</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "I looked at poly ratings before signing up for Agronsky and thought it would be a great class to take. Agronsky is really funny and a great guy, but he's one of those teachers who knows his material so well that he leaves the class behind sometimes. If anyone has homework questions, he'll usually spend at least half the class time going over the problems. This sounds great, but you're left not knowing the lesson for tonight's homework all that well, and the vicious cycle continues. He tends to use one example to explain a lot of different concepts, so I suggest you write down everything he says because he rarely writes down the thought process behind the examples. I was really bummed with my grade since I went to class every day and did all of my homework the whole quarter. I didn't go office hours, but I have a feeling that would have helped me. Actually, I'm pretty sure I should have gotten a straight F, but he really was a nice guy and gave me a D+, so my GPA didn't suffer too much from it.

      "Agronsky was horrible at recognizing students' needs.  Everyday I would walk out of class not knowing what the hell he was trying to teach.  You would spend 3/4 of the class going over last night's homework so he would \"teach\" that night's lesson in about 5 minutes.  So the cycle continued of never knowing how to do the homework.  He expected you to already know vital information even though it was a Calc 1 class.  His tests are extremely difficult.  He doesn't give any review sheet or anything he just tells you to \"know the homework\" which meant going over hundreds of problems.  But even if you studied every homework problem and knew how to do them he would throw in tricks on the test which made every problem horribly difficult to finish.  I would never take Agronsky again unless I plan on studying for hours and hours and still getting a shitty grade.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

If you take him fall quarter, his halloween outfit is the best. His tests can be difficult if it is the first time you've seen calculus material. I think they were fair overall. I just didn't know what to expect from the math department. I was doing quite poorly, but he reasoned out a way that the homework grade and the final could help me and I got by with a C. However, I am now in 241 pushing my way through triple integrals and the Jacobian methods and I am so happy that this man challenged me so that calculus 4 is a breeze.

He does have some challenging problems on some of his tests and especially the final.  One thing to remember is if he emphasizes that a problem in the homework is REALLY important, then study that problem for the final because it will most likely show up.  He is a really fair grader and is willing to discuss your grade on a midterm or homework.  He accepts late homework too, but only up to like 3-4 times in the quarter.  Overall he is a great teacher and you would be an idiot to pass him up.  Plan your schedule around his class.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Is Agronsky really as good as his reviews make him out to be? Absolutely. He is not just the best math teacher I've ever had, he's also the best one I've had at Cal Poly. He presents the material in an easy to understand way. He goes over any questions on the homework, no matter how long it takes! If the class didn't understand something, he postponed doing the next section and went over the previous one. One of the best things about him is that he doesn't give pointless quizzes every week. They eat up a lot of time and make teaching rushed. Also, with weekly quizzes you are constantly studying and worrying about them. Instead, he grades the homework and has two midterms. You just have to attempt the homework questions to get credit. You don't have to finish them all or get them right. If you can't do some of them, just ask him to go over them in class. All the tests are fair and are very similar to the homework. I went back and did a few questions out of every section to prepare for the midterm and did well. Don't misunderstand. Calculus II is a lot work no matter whom you have. You have to complete and assignment every night. If you're not willing to put in the work, you'll fail the class, just like with any other teacher. Make sure that you show up every day! Don't blow the class off, ever. Otherwise, you'll miss his easy to understand teaching, get a zero on the homework, and have to figure out the next homework on your own, which is not fun.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Dr. Agronsky is an incredible professor. After reading all these reviews of him you'll think you have a good idea of the guy, but you won't. He'll come into class the first day an you'll think the wrong professor walked in the door, but no, it's Agronsky, and he'll blow you away. Hilarious, presents material FLAWLESSLY, and incredibly helpful in office hours. Homework every night, but it is graded credit/no credit based on completion, but to honest, graded homework every night in a math class is a good thing, and you know it. Other than the homework, which counts for almost none of the grade, too, are two midterms and a final. The midterms are either really easy, or really hard depending on if you know the material (which means doing the homework). The final, contrary to the consensus on these ratings, is also easy or hard, depending on how well you know the material. If you have the choice, you'd be an idiot not to take Agronsky.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

Homework is due the next class period, but all you have to do is try to do your homework to get full credit.  The students take turns checking, so you need to make only a minimal effort.  He assigns a fair load of homework problems, not too many.  Test problems are from the homework, so make sure to study it.  The tests are reasonably graded so that little mistakes will not get you a huge deduction as long you know what you are doing.  The tests did have some really challenging problems and the final has some really hard problems.  But nothing impossible is on the test and lengthwise, they are doable in less than 50 minutes.  You get a sheet of notes on the exam, so you do not have to do any strenuous memorizing at all.  So do whatever it takes to get this guy.  It fills up fast, but it is well worth it, even if doesn't make sense in your schedule.  You will want to have him again.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "THE MAN. this guy \"steve\" is an amazingly caring person and loves to teach. whats better is that he also does an amazing job. He makes sure that you are fully comfortable with the material before he goes on. For the midterms he didn't really care if you made a little mistake of a minus sign or messed up while adding terms. He just cares about if you really understand how to do the problems. If any one had a problem with this guy then they really are just messed up. He is so friendly in class, loves what he does and makes us actually start to love math as hard as that sounds. TAKE HIM although he will probably fill up first infront of all other teachers so if you can take him go for it.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

He's just the greatest all-around profesor.  He knows the material extremely well, and loves to help out students.  He just loves students, and wants to make sure they succeed.  Something which, unfortunatly, a lot of profesors lack.  He assigns a standard amount of homework for a math class, but you can easily get away with not doing it.  If you come up to him, and tell him:  \"I didn't understand it.  I'll turn it in tomorow.\"  You will get full credit.  How fuckin cool is that?  His midterms aren't too bad, I thought, and he gives really good partial credit.  That is, if you know what you're doing.  But besides his superb teaching abilities, the best part about Dr. Agronsky is his hilarious sense of humor.  It has this really dry sense of humor, that new students don't even catch onto until the second week or so.  But it's just fucking hilarious.

What makes him so great?  1. Dr. Agronsky is a great teacher.  He knows the material extremely well, and teaches it even better.  He's always willing to make sure students understand the material, and is very helpful.  But combined with that, is that he is FRIGGIN' HILARIOUS.  He has this very original sense of humor, which new students don't catch on to until about the second week.  But if you take him for multiple classes, you're already used to it, and it's seriously some funny shit.  He's probably the only profesor who could make \"Differential Equations\" a FUN class.  On grading...He is more-than-fair with grading exams.  You'll get loads of partial credit, and you'll love it.  And, if you've had him for more than one class, and he knows you, he'll \"help you out\", if you know what I mean.  I should of clearly got a B+ in 242, but he gave me an A.

I consider myself a pretty good math student and I think that the grade I earned in the class is not to be blamed on Professor Agronsky.  He helped he as much as he could. I was in his office hour everyday that I could be there to get help with this class.  He was very helpful in his office hour, trying to make sure that you fully understand the concept.  He is much of the same way in class in the fact that he really tries to make sure you understand and he is very understanding if you don't.  The only thing that I could possibly criticize is that his teaching style is a little unorthodoxe from some of my math teacher's in the past.  His teaching lesson that he has when he comes into the class doesn't seem too concrete when he is presenting it.  Of course it just maybe because it was a hard ass class.  The material is difficult to grasp, at least for me,  some people had no problem with it.  But that's besides the point.  The point is Professor Agronsky is an excellent teacher and I would definitely take him again.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

When going over old quizzes he would have students come to the board to put up answers. However, if students werent sure about an answer and asked him if it was correct, he always replied \"I don't know is it?\". Obviously if the whole class is asking no one knows the answer but he still wouldn't help. Anytime the class can't answer a one of his questions its because we need to do the reading. Also his midterms are hard as shit. The class average on the first one was a 59 and he didn't curve it. There was also a question that only two people in the entire class got right, but it was our fault because we should have learned it in lab. He also put a question on a quiz with material he told us we didn't have to know, the class did terribly so he made us taking it again without telling us. When someone asked if we had to know the material because he said we didn't have to, he told us that it was on two quizzes to we should know it now.

Besides prioritizing asinine topics and ignoring important and relevant ones, to actually learn the class material you essentially have to teach yourself. Inconsistent, unfair grading makes test taking the roller-coaster ride it shouldn't be. He recognizes it too. I know several case of cheating that occurred and he essentially ignored them. As a professor he is honestly now better then a mannequin (and the mannequin would be more interesting and lively). If there is a way to convey information in a morning vapid and dull way, Javier will find it. The numerous personal grudges that he carries make surviving his class with a good grade nearly impossible. I'm not saying that he doesn't have the potential to be a ok professor, I'm just saying that he'd probably have to restart school from the second grade.

Go to his office hours and be polite or else he will just answer all your questions with \"that was in your book, didn't you read?\" or \"google it\" or tell you that you asked a good question and then walk away.

Dr. Aguilera doesn't give homework problems, doesn't tell us what we should be focusing on when he tells us to read chapters from our textbook (which he haphazardly throws in at the end of his lectures; lots of things we read in the textbook seem to have no significance to class or to tests), never gives definitive answers for quizzes or just questions in general, has consistent mistakes in slide shows, skips over things in his slide shows if he doesn't like our attitude, etc. Half of the things we read in the textbook have nothing to do with tests or quizzes, and half of what is on the tests has nothing to do with what was in the textbook, labs, or learned in lecture. When asked questions, he rarely gives answers and will halt class to get multiple students' opinions instead of just giving a correct answer. He doesn't curve his tests, quizzes, or labs; even if every single person fails a question or a quiz, he says we need to study more instead of looking at himself to see if he facilitated learning on it. He is shameless in the fact that he is an incompetent professor, and he won't accept responsibility for the \"failure\" of his students, even when we had no way of knowing what to study. His office hours are also very unhelpful. If you come in 20 minutes after office hours started and he already went over a question, he will complain about how he already did it. He acts as though he is doing us a favor by screenshotting problems from the textbook and putting them in the powerpoint for us to do, or by \"reviewing\" anything at all, even if it was new information.

As for the slides he does present: we work on problems in class, however, if nobody knows how to do a problem he gets angry and says \"well i'm going to skip over this one since clearly none of you have done your homework.\" Only after appalled reactions from his students did he go back and HAVE A STUDENT work out the problem, neither confirming nor denying the solution presented.

      "Has absolutely no clue what he is talking about. there have been instances where the class will correct him on something that he says as we reference the book, he'll look at the book which word for word will say that he is 100 % wrong and he'll still argue that the book is wrong and he is right except he gives no reason why he is right. I went to see him during his office hours after getting D on the midterm. I told him I didn't know how to approach a few problems and he told me that I have to resolve that issue before I come see him again. so basically I'm supposed to go learn how to do the problem without any help and then go to your office hours? if you ask him any questions during lecture he'll either tell you to google it or he'll google it for you with the projector on with no shame. I'm just wondering who gave this guy a Ph.D. Horrible professor. Horrible person as he's very condescending and rude. avoid at all cost. even the TA's in this class ridicule his teaching methods. 100% of the time the TA's know more about the subject matter than he does</div></div></div><br/>\n",

Not only does he refuse to answer any sort of question but he also doesn't seem to have any knowledge of the subject matter however he will take every opportunity to insist that he is right even when what he is saying is blatantly refuted by the textbook, TAs, other professors. How this man got a PhD is beyond me. He spends the majority of lecture time telling the class all the ways that we are bad students, and never ceases with condescending remarks. He acts as if he is doing the world a favor by copy and pasting problems from the book onto slides for us to do but god forbid he actually go over a problem. It is not worth it to take this professor. Even if this is the only section you can get into. Even if not taking this class would push back your graduation date.

      "Example problems are very rare in his class and the few times they do appear they are often skipped over because of a lack of time, or skimmed over in a manner that does no one any help and ultimately leaves us with more questions than answers. It is incredibly hard to get a clear answer to any of his examples. \r\n",
      "There are errors in his powerpoint more times than not and they are always very confusing and hard to follow, looking around the room you can usually tell that no one is ever writing any notes besides the few equations that are given. \r\n",
      "His quizzes also contain errors and problems that make no sense. There was a problem that had two completely right answers which were something along the lines of “supersaturated solutions are very unstable” and “not all ionic substances increase in solubility with an increase in temperature”. Discussing the quiz after taking it a few students got into an actual argument with him over the quiz and it finally took the LA to show him that the problem was contradictory and ultimately he answered “well you just have to pick the MOST correct answer”\r\n",
      "Later that day we got our lab reports back and again there were errors on that which students asked him about and he replied with something along the line of “I’m right and you’re wrong”, again, the LAs had to show him where his error was.\r\n",
      "Class gets so bad and there was so much tension in the class that at least 5 students got up and left periodically throughout the 3 hour class. It was chaos.\r\n",
      "We spent easily over an hour looking at the molecular structure of the hemoglobin protein online which served no purpose at all besides to drill into us the point that hemoglobin has both hydrophobic and philic parts to it. The lack of class time is completely his fault.\r\n",
      "I stand by my assertion that I have learned nearly everything this quarter from other professors, the LAs, Khan Academy, my AP Chemistry notes from last year, the chem book and my friends in other 125/128 classes. I feel that his classes (besides labs) are a complete waste of time and I can confidently say that most of my peers feel the same way.\r\n",
      "He is also confrontational, and will pull kids out of class or after class to basically tell them that he doesn’t like their questions and that they are being rude/disruptive. This just makes everyone ask even fewer questions, leaving more in the unknown.\r\n",
      "I know that poly ratings isn’t exactly a “professional” or objective way of rating a professor but these entries are dead on accurate from what I’ve experienced in class. \r\n",
      "My last point about the class is his use of google. You would be appalled to see how many times we are told to google our questions. \r\n",

Not one time have I seen him answer a question in lab of in lecture. Also, his grading scheme is very vague. His syllabus is clear, but he always tinkers with the percentages for the 2 midterms. He is not a very approachable person and by the end of the quarter, all the students in my class would rather get a bad grade on a lab or do the lab incorrectly rather than ask him a question.

However he doesn't actually tell you what you need to know in the first place so when you study you have to try to cover LITERALLY EVERYTHING. The lectures, labs, reading assigned, and literally ANY information on google is fair game. When you have a question he tells you that you dont know because you havent learned and you havent learned because you havent studied. Then he tells you to google it because he doesnt have time. This would be a good response if he was a random guy in the street however he is a teacher payed by Cal Poly to teach and I am a student paying to get taught. If I should just google it why the F8ck do I need to take a class on it.

He is very unclear in lecture(what there is of a lecture during lab), accusatory, and expects way too much for students taking a survey class who haven't learned the concepts he is teaching fully in lecture yet. His quizzes don't really happen but when they do they are very specific to the reading and his lecture, and don't reflect what was on the lab write up. He is very helpful in office hours, going over everything on the lab to basically ensure 100 on your lab. However he is a bit of a struggle during class. He expects you read the lab so you will have 0 questions on how to do things, so don't ask questions during lab or he'll assume you didn't read the lab/threaten to take away technique points. We were sort of the Guinea pig class for him but he didn't acknowledge this fact so we felt the burn. Overall not a bad person if you go to office hours, but his class is a struggle to get through on a weekly basis no matter how much you go to office hours or how much he likes you. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

He even wrote a note on my lab partner's lab for that class saying that if she had any problems with me she could come talk to him, basically encouraging another student to rag on me, and singling me out. He wouldn't stop picking on me throughout the remaining labs.  I actually left crying once. If I had a question (about something that he never taught but expected us to know) he would accuse me of not reading the lab and wouldn't give me an answer because I didn't read the lab (when I did...). It was the worst three hours of my week. Some random person who was in my class saw me one day the next quarter and asked me if I survived with a decent grade and we reminisced on how annoying the class was and it validated everything.

Just because you're too old to be in an industry any more doesn't mean you're fit to teach. He frequently deviates from the topics at hand(most of the time its a struggle to even figure out what you're supposed to be learning) during his lectures and seldom makes notes on the board to help you follow his skewed logic. Unless you are born and raised in the horse industry or are an equine major don't even consider this class. His tests are completely biased to people already familiar with the topic as evidenced by their questions regarding in depths analysis of topics he mentioned briefly(if at all) in class.

The only reason I actually learned something was because of a few study sessions that a graduate student put on for our class.  The material wasn't that hard once the grad student explained it.

      "At the beginning of the quarter, I thought I was in for 11 weeks of hell with Aherns class, simply because I read his previous evaluations on here. I was pleasantly surprised to realize over the course of the quarter that a lot of the people on here are simply the ones that never showed up to class or didn't pay attention. Yes, Ahern tends to ramble off topic and he'll put random charts up and never really clearly explain what it is. He could also help his students out by actually breaking each chapter up into sections with clearly labeled names to make studying easier. However, I think he's a much easier teacher than Hurley. For one, his final is only 2 hours long, instead of 6, because he knows its ridiculous to have a six hour final. His midterms are difficult to study for because the questions are usually conceptual and don't involve a lot of math, which is strange in an Econ class. If you had Jenkins for Business Calc and passed this class will be a breeze. If you had some random professor that didn't actually teach derivatives, good luck with the material.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

I've had Ahern for AGB 303, 433, 460, 461, and he's my student advisor.  He has a great sense of humor and an extremely rigid teaching style.  He knows what he's talking about and if you don't understand then you probably shouldn't have passed the prerequisite courses for his classes.  I encourage you to go to his office hours and ask him questions in class as he can explain things well if you pull your heads out of your asses and listen.  I was terrified of taking 433 because the last statistics class I had taken was 2 1/2 years prior, but he really makes you understand/remember things.  His statistics quiz is online and he gives you three weeks to do it and three chances on top of that, piece of cake and if you failed it then you're a moron.  Midterms are difficult, but he gives study guides and review sessions, so if you study you'll be fine.  If you all want to grow up and become a real college student someday who'll be successful in the real world then challenge yourself people!</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "First off, as stated repeatedly below, AVOID THIS GUY AT ALL COSTS.  Ahern can be compared to an unassuming food you ate.  The food first appeared alright, but in the course of eating it you experienced severe gastrointestinal distress.  You then vow to never eat that food again and deter anyone else from it.  To put it bluntly, Ahern is the most arrogant, sorry excuse for an educator, I have ever come across in my lifetime.  How he is still teaching at Cal Poly is beyond fathomable.  Don�t bother asking for any help, he gets off on belittling students, and provides you with no help whatsoever.  I once walked into his office to ask for clarification on a paper and he completely blew me off!  To say he is a biased grader is an understatement; other students in the class share this same fact based opinion.  If he does not like the topic of your senior project he will display it in words (in front of the class I might add), and on the scores you get on assignments.  I changed my topic a few weeks into the quarter and my scores immediately plummeted (my quality of work did not change).  Some say to take Ahern for AGB 460 because MacDougall is so horrible (I didn�t have a choice).  After taking the class with Ahern I cannot comprehend how MacDougall can possibly be any worse!  Bottom line, Ahern teaching AGB 460 provides an unwarranted slap in the face to hardworking seniors.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

The problem is he is a smart guy, but thinks that he is way smarter than he is.  To make himself feel way smarter he really likes to publicly prove that he is smarter than his students.  Be prepared for this sort of behavior instead of him actually ever teaching you anything.  460 was much the same, only the content of the class was less foreign.  His grading is extremely biased based on the person, and I was not his favorite.  The most constructive notes he ever wrote on any of my papers concerned formatting. Other than these it was all shit, including him accusing me of being purposefully vague, throwing in random statistics symbols that I have no idea how they relate to what i was talking about, and telling me that I\\'m wasting paper by printing out the stuff he told me to include!

There was also a project where we chose a lab experiment and identified all of the dangers of the chemicals.

      "The best way I can describe Ahlgren is endlessly frustrating.  I'd stop showing up to lecture for a week or two after a test, and then, like an amnesia patient, I go back, sit through lecture, and wonder all over again why I went in the first place.  His lectures tend to be somewhat repetetive and slow.  Lots of examples.  Without numbers though.  He hates numbers, and math.  I've taken him in other courses, but he never changes.  He doesn't collect homework (I don't think he likes grading).  There were only three tests for your whole grade and he drops the lowest.  Oh and they're multiple choice.  It was a little odd at first, but after a year I understand them a lot better.  He'll give you three problems that he breaks down into 5 questions for each so around 15 questions.  Supposedly, he says that he chooses the test problems from the homework, but it's more strange than it sounds.  He says that he takes the concept that you were supposed to learn from that problem and uses that to recreate another problem.  ...?  Never seemed like that to me.  Anyway, he's nice guy and I think he just wants someone to come to office hours.  Pretty easy to get a good grade with him.  He curves the average to a B-  </div></div></div><br/>\n",

Also, it's pointless to ask him any questions because he will spend 45 minutes deriving a formula and then run out of time. At least you are pretty much guaranteed a B- in this class because he curves like 75% of the students to it. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "To start off, I don't think Ahlgren is a bad guy but he is a bad teacher. It may be because it was his first time teaching the class but I'm not completely sure. Now to the facts. The way his class is set up is that homework is optional but if you do it you get an automatic 5% toward your final grade. Theres is also an optional project that also gives an automatic 5% toward your final grade. If you do not do the homework or the project your entire grade is based off of three non cumulative exams, two of which are during the quarter and the last is during finals week. He takes the best two out of three and those are used to compute your final grade. The exams are multiple choice with 3 questions with multiple parts. He grades on a curve and in then end you are pretty much guaranteed a C- or better. This being said, his class is basically a self study class. His lectures end up being a week behind his schedule and the lectures themselves are not very helpful in doing the homework which is what the tests are based off of. Most people stop going to class after the first test. If it wasn't for the curve almost everyone would be failing. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

Add in that the tests are all multiple choice scantrons and that he is very good about giving points back if you have the right approach written down on the paper copy, you stand a good chance at getting a B or better with little effort. \r\n",

Trust me, he may not be the best/worst teacher in EE department(not very eloquent like Mr. B) (but not terrible like MR. C), but he know what the student want, and if you just listen to his advice, he will give it to you. There are about 60 peoples in class this quarter, and more than half of the class get A. So, study hard, and listen to his advice, and you will be happy. If you did poorly on his multiple choices test, well, just try your best to make a comeback, especially the final.

      "If you're looking for an easy A, this is your professor. His grading is based on the following: 6 exams (drops the lowest)... then in each of the 6 exams, there's 6 questions, where the lowest scored question gets dropped. The final day is broken into 2 exams (#5 and #6) where #6 is cumulative over the whole quarter. I learned a lot of new material in this class... there's homework but it's not required. In all honesty, I didn't do a single hw problem the whole quarter and I pulled a B- at the very end. If you actually do the hw then you'll be gauranteed an A, pretty much. You get to use 2 sides of a 8.5\"x11\" piece of paper for each exam (so you'll have 5 sheets by the end of the quarter)... write these very carefully! They'll be your life-saver in the exams. One major problem with his lectures is that there's so much material that he'll skip like 1/2 the stuff in the quarter, and just say \"read the book and do the problems and if you have any issues, come see me in my office hours\"... ugh. It was quite annoying. Don't get me wrong, Ahlgren has lots of experience with what he's talking about... he's quite qualified, and an overall a good professor.

      "Yes, at first, ahlgren seems like a really nice guy, but as far as him being an effective teacher, he's horrible. This guy is a total spaz, and as a result, it's rediculously easy to throw him off-track with the lecture. This one guy asked him a yes or no question and it took ahlgren 45 minutes to answer it. I don't understand how anyone could do that, but he managed it. As far as actually learning anything, stick to the book as best you can, but he makes it hard as well. He'll assign about a hundred pages a week, spread out in cmall clumps over 5 or 6 chapters. He'll bounce around the book like a cerebal palsy victim trying to play racketball. Here is an example from his syllabus. The following chapters were assigned for reading (in this order): 1, 3, 1, 13, 11, 3, 5, 13, 17, 18, 4, 7.\r\n",

He uses the EXACT same problems each year in his tests. As far as actually understanding the material, try to talk to pretty much anyone else in the department. they will be more easily understandable, less spastic, and you will learn more from them.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "I pretty much agree with the guy below's statement. The only reason he has a  reasonably high score (2.86/4 currently) is because he has relatively easy tests. No offense to the EE's out there (I'm CPE), but every EE teacher I've had (6) either can't teach or can't speak clear and loud English. Sometimes both. Maybe it's just bad luck and I ran into alot of bad professors, but whatever. I stopped showing up after 3 weeks, and with some small amounts of studying I was at least able to work through most of the problems for the 2nd midterm and final. He also needs to learn how to write on the board and not crowd it. When he's drawing graphs we need to draw them with him instead of sitting there for a minute wandering our heads around, then catching up while he goes on to the next one. I got my first midterm, it was a little higher than 50% but he put a C on the grade. Most people were like that too, with grades around 50s 60s but had C's and B's. I assumed he gave us a curved score, but of course I was wrong. He mentioned to the class in almost exact wording that \"that wasn't really your grade on the paper, just something I put on there because students like to see letters.\" Everyone just kind of looked at each other and laughed quietly, confused with that ridiculous and totally ineffective philosophy. If anything that made me take the class less seriously which is never a good sign. Oh yeah and the week after the midterm when he started saying everything wrong and having students correcting him wasn't too reassuring either. I quit going after the 3rd week because I wasn't getting anything from the lecture, and was afraid I was going to be taught something wrong if another student didn't catch the mistake. You can take that for whatever you want, I'm a slacker, the class was too hard for me, whatever. Bottom line was he is the kind of professor that if I were trying to become a teacher, I would think \"Don't do what this guy did because I would want my students to actually learn something.\"</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Ahlgren is bad at teaching. He knows a lot of stuff but he is just not organized enough to explain the material properly. He assigns homework but doesn't collect it which is good for people who want an easy quarter. Thing is most of the stuff in EE306 is super important for the next class EE307. So if you take him and end up without the proper fundamentals for transistor circuits, there is no hope for you in EE307 unless you are really smart or you work really hard. My suggestion is to take EE306 with a good teacher like Braun who is hard. When you are done with the course you will have learned much more than a BJT characteristic curve. It seemed to me like Ahlgren wasted a lot of lectures for no reason because the course not only consisted of knowing BJTs but the characteristics of MOSFETs and JFETs as well. If you have no choice but to take him, make sure you are prepared to learn everything on your own. There is no point half-assing this course.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

We learned diodes, BJT's and FET's in this class so we definitely covered all the devices we were supposed too.  At the beginning of the quarter, the course schedule had around 40 topics on it and i believe we covered around 25.  If you take Ahlgren make sure you READ THE BOOK and know that you will most likely have to do some review for 307/308 when you arrive.  All in all I thought he was fair.  There were a LOT of homework problems assigned but the exams(2 midterms and a final) are all based off the homework.  He also lets you have a lot of reference material.

      "If you learn out of textbooks well, then Ahlgren is a great teacher to take.  He assigns homework, and the test problems are very similar to the homework.    He doesn't even care whether or not you come to class.  In fact, coming to class is probably a complete waste of time, unless it's a test day.  After taking two classes with him, I came to the conclusion that his lectures concentrate on the theory, which is generally too abstract to stick with most people, but the homework and tests are on the applications of the material, which the lecture does nothing to prepare you for.  This is the only teacher that has given me below a B in an EE course, so I completely plan on avoiding him.\r\n",

It's the same issue every quarter - there is too much [overwhelming] material that he just curves the entire class to pass. Most people get Cs, and people who put a bit of effort into scoring well on exams get Bs and As. Exams are 3 out of 4 questions, and have easy and hard parts. Most people skipped lecture after the first couple weeks, since it really wasn't worth it at all. He really wants people to learn but the class is tough and not as important as other classes. He gives you solutions to HW beforehand so that copying is pointless, and everyone does it anyways. He lets you bring a sheet of notes or two, but people brought in everything.

Just connect some coaxial cables together, make some measurements, save the screenshots (it doesn't matter if they are right or not, just make sure there's something on the screen) and run like hell out the door when he isn't looking. No joke, this is what we did once we wised up. He tries to explain things in class and in office hours, yet he lacks a fundamental understanding of transmission line theory. After hearing him say \"You are confused, I am confused, and that is a good thing\" I gave up. Instructions to build your lab notebook(which is required): Cut the spine off of your lab manual. Glue all of these pages in your lab notebook. Add screenshots from instruments and some hand calculations. Run over with car and then spend at least an hour beating up lab notebook with other students in the senior project lab, joking about how awful Ahlgren is. Get an A.

      "For roughly 3-5 questions on each, Ahglren messes up. By messes up, I mean he does not use the correct equations or he makes arithmetic errors. As a result, none of the available answer choices will be correct. This is bad because it makes students confused and doubtful during the exam, making them perform worse by having less time. These tests are time constrained, losing this amount of time is not an insignificant factor.\r\n",
      "His errors could be prevented through self review, peer review, or using a written exam instead of scantron. I think any of these options would be an entirely reasonable amount of effort. However, it appears he never tries these. Instead, he tells students to tell him if they think Ahlgren is wrong, or pick the closest answer. The tests are too ambiguous and time constrained to tell him he is wrong. Picking the closest answer is also unsettling. \"Closest answer\" usually does not mean a rounding error, it usually means a massive difference. For example, the \"closest\" to (-1/3) is (+0.28), or the \"closest\" to (100e^-350.0) is (19.0). The first example is the wrong sign, and the magnitude is impossible to be from rounding error.  The second example is literally a difference of 152 orders of magnitude (10^152 times different). \r\n",
      "After exams, points lost due to Ahlgren's mistakes are usually given back. However, he is stubborn and irrational in this process. He will always claim \"well, you should have expected me to make mistakes.\" and \"you should have picked the closest answer, as I told you to\". \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In summary: Ahlgren does not prepare adequately for lectures/examples/homeworkReview. Ahlgren does not prepare his exams adequately, and he makes them in a format that does not properly evaluate students for the subject matter. Ahlgren's stubbornness prevents him from fixing his course in future quarters and years.\r\n",

He was super new, and I understand not everyone can be a great professor in their first quarter teaching. This aside, I have never felt more confused, frustrated, and lost in a class. He never presented information clearly, and couldn't understand how to answer questions. This was the first time I had ever taken physics, but he taught to the class like we all should know what is going on. He just kind of spit out words and hoped we would absorb them, and some people did. I unfortunately didn't, and I can honestly say I've never felt more stupid that sitting in this class. When people asked questions to clarify things, he would repeat what he just and then say \"okay?\" and move on. After the midterm (which he waited until week 6 for us to take), I had to get a tutor just to make sure I passed the class. I learned more from the tutor in three hours a week than I did in any of the time Adeel spent lecturing.I'm not writing this out of being bitter for getting a C, because I can honestly say its a miracle I passed the class. I'm just trying to give my perspective on how the quarter went. I know a lot of people in that class aced everything and did perfectly fine. but coming from someone who can usually do pretty well teaching themselves, definitely only take this class if you're either a)naturally a genius at physics or b)mentally prepared.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Mixed feelings about this class/professor. Physics is a difficult class and that seems like it would be best taught by a teacher with a lot of experience. To my understanding, Adeel didn't have a lot of experience. At times, this showed. He would often ask us to solve problems before teaching us HOW to solve them.... being an hour long class, we usually got through two problems max, or had to stop half way through a problem and start back up the next day, which made things even more confusing. He sometimes rushed through problems or taught them to the white board rather than the class. He always stopped to ask if we had questions, but he wasn't always able to answer them in ways we could understand. His accent was very noticeable but wasn't really distracting nor did it take away from our ability to learn. I put in minimal work for this class, barely understood anything, and came out with a B- thanks to how he grades/weighs things.

      "I liked him overall, he was pretty straightforward when presenting the material especially because his lectures came straight from the text book so anytime I was having trouble with a concept that I couldn't understand in lecture I was able to read how the text book explained it using the same examples from class. Some concepts took way too long to explain and felt somewhat convoluted, but given that it was his first quarter teaching I cut him slack for that and I think he just needs experience to cut back on the misuse of lecture time. And super nice btw I had to miss class for an exam and he allowed me to take it during office hours, and patient too</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "This class was ridiculous. Based off of the first few days I thought it would be kind of interesting, but it ended up being a joke. Sociology in general is sketchy and it reflected in the class. First off, all of Alaniz's lectures lacked info that was actually going to be on the test, and they were 2 hours long. All the info was from the textbook, so by the end of the quarter I had hardly any class notes. Second, most of the questions on the exams didn't have a clear answer or had multiple answers that seemed correct. Going over the exams in class, he had to explain every answer and everyone was arguing with him over them. He said he would try to make the next exam more straight forward but it was the same. Basically, this class and the way Alaniz presented the material felt juvenile. I definitely don�t recommend this class. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Dr. Alaniz is one of the most genuine professors I have had at Cal Poly. With that being said, he is not effective in writing tests that represents the material covered in class and that he stresses to be important. I understand that sociology itself (especially intro to sociology) can be rather ambiguous however, I feel as if the material that we were expected to know was not clearly defined. The course would cover large topics such as \"poverty\" and \"inequality\" but then on the exams there would be random statistics of poverty that we might have taken 5-10 min. to cover. Personally I did not resonate with how the exams were set up - I'm sure there were many other students that would disagree but I figured I should voice my opinion. The material in the course is relevant to us and I enjoyed learning about the topics in SOC 110</div></div></div><br/>\n",

He managed to make this class interesting and informative - which is saying a lot, because my section was from 7 am to 9 am twice a week. The material was very easy to understand and he made lectures interesting with activities and relevant videos and movie clips. There were a few short, 5 point papers that you  had to write throughout the quarter, which helped boost your grade. He also would reward those of us who woke up for his class by taking attendance - he's very understanding. The tests are not hard at all as long as you go to class and at least skim, if not read, the textbook. Ryan is an amazing professor who cares about you as a student also. He always addressed us as \"future leaders of the world\" and emphasized the power that we have as individuals. All in all, such an awesome professor who is passionate about his work and is always ready to help us as students, both academically and personally. Maybe I'm biased because I got a good grade and am a sociology major, but I'm definitely taking any class he teaches in the future if possible!</div></div></div><br/>\n",

The lectures go by quickly because they are entertaining and well thought out. I guarantee this class will change  the way you look at society, social interaction and academia. Your grade is made up of 4 short essays, a midterm, and final. The essays are graded very leniently and can be completed the night before they are due. The midterm and final are  traditional multiple choice  and true/false exams. The information for the exams come directly from the lecture (~70%) and the book/context reader (~30%). Exams are very manageable and fair, not to mention he curves the exams by a few points. On top of the curve, he offers up to 7% points of EASY extra credit points by doing small writing assignments throughout the quarter. Dr. Alaniz makes getting an A+ in this class VERY doable. The only downside to this class is that you must attend class to get notes because he doesn’t post the slides on Polylearn. TIPS FOR GETTING A GOOD GRADE: do the extra credit (that is a no brainer), allow yourself 2-3 days to study for the exams, study ALL of your notes not just what's on the study guide, and make sure read ALL the context reader sections!</div></div></div><br/>\n",

Do the Intro to Sociology readings, because they will show up on the text, but just skim the contexts reader and note the general argument because there will only be general questions about them.

      "I can not emphasize how much I LOVED this class and Dr. Alaniz. I wish everyone had the opportunity to take this class because it opened up my mind to new perspectives and issues that are important and relevant to everyone. Dr. Alaniz is a great professor and person. He made the material presented super interesting, relevant, and I looked forward to going to class. On top of that, he is a virtuous person and it's evident he cares for the subject he's teaching. His passion easily rubs off on people in the class. I could ramble on forever about how much I loved the class and Dr. Alaniz but to make things short, it's an easy A if you do the readings and listen and attend all of his lectures. The class basically consists of 4 very short essays, a midterm, a final, and he gives you an extra credit opportunity. If you go into his office hours, he's super nice and helpful. I really didn't spend an excessive amount of time on this class and in the end, you get the grade you deserve.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "I loved this class. However, this really isn't the type of class where you focus on the grade, but the content. That was a hard realization for me, because GPA is important to me, as it is to everyone else. Anyways, this class was a bit boring at first and hard to wake up at 7 am for, although I'm glad I kept showing up because towards the end it gets so interesting and inspiring. In regards to the content, as long as you keep showing up you can get an A. Most likely, you'll do poorly on the midterm, I got a 70% on mine. After that, I really put in work on the papers and did the readings, but studied very little for the final because I got the the point of knowing the information from the homework and lectures, so I ended up with an A. You can tell Dr. Alaniz is passionate about his profession, and I think that's a valuable quality for a teacher. His grading is a bit unclear, and his office hours are usually a bit hectic, but this course is doable and the work load is very manageable.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

In his syllabus he stresses that he tries not to bombard you with too much reading. I personally found that there was quite a bit of reading necessary for the class. The chapters are quite lengthy and full of lots of information, but if you take them in small intervals, you will find that the information is really interesting. Make sure to do all of the reading because while his lectures do correlate with the textbook, you will be tested on things that are in the book that he did not go over. His exams are definitely hard, but Dr Alaniz really cares about his students and will give you multiple opportunities for extra credit and they will REALLY help your grade.

If you're looking to take International Political Economy, this class is about the \"Global South\" (third-world countries and the like) and our relationships to them. That is, this is NOT a typical econ class. Some of the material is admittedly high-browed (particularly one of the books, which is very dense) and goes over your head at times, but he is always willing to slow down and explain something again. He has done a lot of work in Latin America, researching and doing service, so he is quite obviously a very passionate guy who wants you to know about these issues. His grading is very fair, despite the fact that there are very few assignments. Some of it can be a challenge, particularly the paper you write about a specific country about halfway through the class. But that aside, Ryan is one the best, most passionate professors I've had at Poly. He will know your name, will stay behind to talk to you if he's got the time, and will tell you all sorts of great anecdotes.

      "The Professor:\n",
      "I saw Professor Alaniz had fantastic ratings so I thought this will be a great class. WRONG! He is very sly about the way he presents his views. He gets students to laugh by saying F*** a lot. He says he is only presenting theories to consider. He tries to appear unbiased and open to discussion, but they are so blatantly LIBERAL. He uses GUILT to try and persuade you to his views. What class was like: [Anti-American Socialism, capitalism is terrible, America was built on the backs of the poor, colonization is the reason we have poor countries, we are responsible to help the poor countries cause we ruined them in the first place, you have the privilege of ignorance, you are an awful human being cause you buy Starbucks, which exploits the poor and really isn't fair trade, meat is the reason we have global warming, etc.. you get the idea] It was difficult to tune out the liberal agenda. If you have no choice, you will survive, I did. Don't let it get to you and realize there is this thing called OPINION, which is different than fact. He gets you to really think about what you believe and why. It made me appreciate history so much more, and how important it is to know rather than just believe what you're told. He seems to have a huge heart for the poor, but his solution is to take the money from the rich and give it to the poor. Overall, He shows up on time. He is extremely passionate about his views. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Class itself:\n",
      "There are heavy daily readings with possible pop quizzes. You get 0.5 of a point for writing your name on your paper and leaving it blank (admitting to not reading). You get no points if you BS the quiz. You get 2 points for the correct answer. Overall these don't count that much in your grade, but it is good to know the reading for the 1 Midterm and 1 Final. There are a few papers that are graded super easy if you add a poor them attitude into it. The midterm and final were really hard (I didn't do my reading), and took a lot of studying. He gives you a study guide which is basically bullet points of the whole class (AKA not really a study guide). Someone in my class made a google doc for the whole class. We filled in the definitions and our notes, which I totally recommend taking advantage of, but it was still hard.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Alaniz is a great guy. This class made me feel more knowledgable about the world we live in and made me feel passionate to take greater care of each other. This class will educate you on far more than just academics if you listen to what he is saying. I took this class instead of Econ for one of my D GE's, and I am so happy I made this decision. I feel way more politically and socially informed after taking this class and I think that anybody that has the opportunity to take this class should. As far as workload, it is totally easy to get an A or B in this class. He assigns readings every night (which I think were pretty excessive), but they do show up on the exams. If just while you're studying for the tests you skim each reading and understand who the author is, what the author stands for, and what the main points are than you should be fine. In lecture, he will every once in a while give random \"participation\" points where you have to answer some question about the reading. If you show up, you get 50% credit on the participation and if you did the reading too then you get 100%. He gives 4 assignments throughout the quarter which are a majority of your grade and are super easy to get an A on.  Just follow the rubric closely. The exams felt pretty hard when I was taking them but I think that was just because I didn't really do the readings. When studying, make sure you study the readings just as much as the lecture notes. He gives you a short answer at the end of the exam and tells you the prompt beforehand so you can prepare. So, he's basically giving you free points on a quarter of the test. He also gave us an extra credit assignment that bumped our midterm grade up a whole letter. Overall, I love Alaniz and if you let it, this class will really inspire and enlighten you. The workload is totally manageable and it's an easy A if you show up to lecture and do the assignments. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Alaniz is such a stand up teacher that I risked taking a 7 am with him Spring Quarter. Not only is Alaniz's class very manageable in terms of homework, but he fully explains every subject within lectures and makes it very easy for students to comprehend concepts discussed both in class and out. I barely did any of the readings, but took notes in class everyday, and pulled away with an A. The class is incredibly interesting, and critical of many organizations and standards that modern society takes for granted/accepts blindly. Alaniz presents logical and well supported evidence to present his arguments, and is able to defend them if asked. Much of the class is intended to challenge student's mindsets rather than their ability to memorize. Aside from the class, Alaniz is a generally inspiring, kind and funny guy, and a good teacher. He also brought baby goats into class for our only midterm (if you weren't already convinced to take his class). </div></div></div><br/>\n",

Additionally, all of his powerpoint are outdated (he does not post them online) and it is clear that he puts almost no effort into the class. When I attempted to have a conversation with him on a reading he had no idea what I was talking about and it was clear he had not read it. I do not understand how he has a good rating.

      "Dr. Alaniz's class was incredibly biased, and tried to paint a negative view of capitalism without providing a broader context of its benefits. He relied very heavily on anecdotal evidence in most of his lectures and never seemed to fully comprehend the course which he was teaching. When students asked him even basic questions about the course and its material, he very rarely answered with anything other than \"I don't know.\" His lectures often presented outdated, false, or biased information, claiming that he hoped students would \"decide for themselves.\" The course hardly dealt with matters of Political Economy at all, eschewing both the political and the economic side of the subject. Instead, Dr. Alaniz trashed economic indicators and charitable organizations, claimed that every product in our economy is exploitative, and attempted to guilt people out of purchasing anything made internationally. His course deals less with the interactions of politics and economies on the international scale, and more on the hardships of individuals in various \"Global South\" (developing) countries. Dr. Alaniz's class appeared to have a clear agenda that he attempted to force onto his students. His examinations would often present questions (especially True or False questions) that were matters of opinion, and had no single answer.\n",

The class wasn't really hard at all in terms of material and his grading on papers etc., but he sometimes throws in these little asshole things that kinda keep you guessing in the class. For example, we had class two times a week on Tuesday and Thursday. Halloween this year was on a Wednesday, and for whatever reason he decided to put the midterm at 7 am the Thursday after Halloween instead of the Tuesday before like alright then. He also makes passive aggressive comments in class sometimes.

He's very very smart, he's done tons of research, worked with the UN and helped found charities, etc. The class in itself is probably my favorite from this year, and it was a GE! In terms of grading, there are 4 assignments worth 10% of your grade each and just try a little and you'll get 100%. Not hard to get a 90 on the midterm, we'll see about the final. Aside from that there are a few pop quiz type things that he uses to make sure we read and count as attendance/participation. Just remember the main idea and three interesting things about each reading and you'll be golden. It's not hard to get an A in this class.

      "Prof. Alexander is a wonderful instructor and I genuinely enjoyed all the assigned reading and lectures. This is not an easy load course but not too heavy for the class level. He is very fair and extremely helpful during his office hours and will tell you exactly what he is looking for when grading. He is prepared for every class and the case studies and in class exercises are engaging. This course is one of the most helpful courses for real world situations and overlaps many of the course topics covered in previous classes. There are two midterms and a final but he drops the lowest grade so you can opt to not take the final. Depending on how my group does on our final group paper and presentation, I expect to get a high B or low A. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

This subject and very broad and dry and he doesn't do a very good job at making it simple. The first test is easy and then the second test is ridiculously hard, which no one expected. His instructions for the group project are VERY vague. He gives you short, vague instructions and then grades unfairly like you were supposed to know what to do.

Looking for ambiguity, poorly outlined projects with stringent grading criteria?... this class is for you! For Fuck-sake the most rewarding part of the class was leaving it. I'm not afraid of a challenge either!!!! Teachers like Gorman, Ayash, and Patel...the real MVP's of the business department HOLLAAA, but the problem with this class is that the professor makes it impossible for you to do well or purvey what he wants because even he is not sure whats going on.

      "Agree that prof. Alexander class is a difficult class but it works taking. He expects students to read the textbook before class and he will just go over the materials and answer it during the first hour of class. The second half is mainly focus on group project where students gather and analyze a corporation, he always walks around class to help and support each group. IF you have read the book, his activities and questions are completely make sense and helps a lot in understand the material. Remember the class was label as a lab, not a lecture ( that's what said in my CalPoly app).  He sometimes brings in interesting activities like the pepsi challenge for the case study, build up the tower with office supplies to demonstrate the VRIO model, etc. \n",
      "There are very few explanation on the concept during class and the PP is use as a support tools for students to know what to learn from the book (at least I think that's what he told me :/) So highly recommend to email him often or go to office hour. He always respond in appropriate timing and have been extra helpful in helping students to success. I'm pretty sure he dislike people who do not prepare and expect to get good grade. Tests are harsh but doesn't cover most of the grade, attendance matters - 20% this Fall quarter, group project and presentation - which I feel like he has graded it easier and online quizzes which are impossible to not get an A. Always keep class in professional manner, projects, dates, lectures, etc. are always up to date so I never worry finding the materials. \n",
      "There sure are a lot of reading, make sure you have sometimes for it, at least 2 hours each week to read. Quizzes are fast, took me like 10 minutes most. :/ Easy B but tough A. I found it helpful as the lectures give me full vision of how to develop a plan to open &amp; build corporation, lot of room to think and to learn, if you seek for information, well, here you go. :/ I just hope they give the pass/ no pass option rather than Grade.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "DURRRRR, that's what you will hear from dekhtyar about 50% of the time. He tends to stutter a LOT during class. I found it funny sometimes how much he did it. CPE 101 is an easy class if you have prior programming knowledge as there is a lot of work in dekhtyar's class and if you don't know how to program well you are pretty much screwed. Some programs too a while, while the others took less than 2 hours. Dekhtyar know's his stuff when it comes to C but he needs to refocus his class on the important stuff, such as not spending a week on what an if statement is and focus on more important things such as structs or file i/o. I understand that it was an intro class but really a whole week on an if statement? too much in my opinion. Overall dekhtyar's class was relatively easy but his lectures were pretty damn boring...</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "BEWARE. CPE 101 is honestly nearly impossible to pass if you've never had any programming experience in your life, like me going into this class. It was a nightmare of a class for me throughout the entire quarter, and my other classes' grades suffered as a result. Alex is extremely intimidating. He assigns honestly and endless and unrealistic amount of work, considering you probably have 3-4 other classes with this. I do not know how you pass this class if it's your first time coding. And I did not blow off this class; I never missed a lecture, just failed at coding, failed all quizzes and midterms and most likely the final. 48% and 34% were my midterm scores. Seems to favorite the students who know what they're doing/have taken it before. I super highly recommend taking advantage of going to the FREE CPE tutoring they have during the week, every day, 7-9pm. I very often went, still failed the class. Alex taught as if everyone had some sort of programming experience. I felt constantly lost and never felt calm/comfortable during this class. I hate Alex. Please do not take him, I am sure there are better teachers out there!</div></div></div><br/>\n",

His lectures were always very clear, and I liked how he printed us lecture notes every day to show us the topics he was going to cover.  He must have killed so many trees printing us all of that stuff, but it helped A LOT, referring back to it and etc. Although I barely passed, he was still pretty awesome to have as my first intro to C.

He lectured incessantly (even lecturing during labs far too often), and our class somehow still managed to be a week and a half behind Dr. Migler's sections by the end of the quarter. He constantly managed to talk for a large amount of time without conveying much information at all. He never finished grading our lab reports (or even started grading them). What we were tested on was more consistent with the book and the homework than it was with his lectures. There isn't that much coding or even work in general for 349, which I thought was a little disappointing because the material is very interesting.

      "Yeah, Alex is awesome. I had this guy for 101 4 years ago and he hasn't changed a bit. Like most of use, he is lazy and has better stuff to do. This means that you won't know if your labs are 100% correct till week 7 and that isn't good news cause you need to build off them for the rest of the labs. Yet, this class is very easy to pick up. SQL is also an essential when it comes to how data is stored. You will learn a lot in this class. I cannot stress the importance of this class. As to difficulty, it's tedious, not hard. The tedious curve starts hard, curves down then up to create a U shape. The reason it get's hard at the end again is because of java/SQL integration called JDBC. But you won't have to worry about that till the end and he explains the integration well enough for it to work (oh and there is a GUI too). The Midterm and Final will have tons of code to write by hand so make sure to stretch your hand once in a while. Overall, great class. Glad I took it. -IF66</div></div></div><br/>\n",

For this class the labs are tedious and do not facilitate learning. He is a decent lecturer but he tends to drift of topic and the material in this class is so mundane that I wager 90% of the students would get the same if not better grades by not attending the lecture. He is unorganized and does not grade on time and in our section of the class he lost a good portion of the midterms and did not realize this until the quarter was almost over (more than a month after the midterm) which forced the class to take another midterm two weeks before finals to make up for his  this. I don't think (or a least I hope) English is his first language and this shows in the labs and questions he writes cause myself and many other students to loose points on labs and midterms due to ambiguous and oft unintelligible wording of his questions. \n",

      "This is my 6th course with Alex Dekhtyar. With this surplus of experience, I hope that my comments can outweigh some of the negative feedback that I was mildly surprised to see here. Some important information about any class you take in his class: 1) Alex knows his shit! Anyone who says otherwise should be ignored. Whether its for class or anything remotely related to databases or data science, Alex is a fantastic resource during office hours. 2) Alex considers lab assignments to be small-scale projects. Yes, these involve more work than most 'lab assignments' at Cal Poly but Alex is very very flexible with due dates (WHEN YOU COMMUNICATE WITH HIM). These projects are very practical and excellent material to discuss with interviewers BECAUSE they are more involved. 3) Individual and group projects are extremely educational! Almost always, the project allows you to apply whatever you have been learning in lecture / labs to something you find interesting. The projects force students to think about how to tackle problems that contain the full software development lifecycle (from the inception of the idea to design to the implementation to presenting these results) I cannot emphasize how valuable these experiences have been in preparing me for industry. 4) If you need an extremely engaging and meticulously organized lecturer... Do NOT take his class. Despite this shortcoming, he is great at answering questions in class or in office hours. (In my experience, the people who complain the most, do very little to help themselves and expect to be spoon-fed the answers to everything) 5) I have never had to purchase a textbook for a course with Alex! If you excel at learning from the notes or assignments, you will do just fine in his classes. (Read the notes ahead of time / during lecture. Pay attention to the examples he does so you can gauge what will be on the midterms...)</div></div></div><br/>\n",

Instead of turning in source code, the primary deliverable for most labs and projects is a written report. Generally, Dekhtyar's lectures are interesting and fun to attend and he is very charismatic. Although class is fun, Dekhtyar's lectures are consistently very difficult to follow; although he does compensate for this with extremely useful pre-printed lecture notes. His lectures cater to individuals with prior experience with data mining which can be very problematic for the average computer science student. Most labs and projects require a massive time commitment (10 to 20 hours) for good results. Almost all assignments are group based. Be EXTREMELY careful in picking a lab partner. Overall I feel that I learned a lot about data mining but the time commitment was very unreasonable at times (4 assignments simultaneously).

It usually took a full two hours, and consisted of her babbling on in a language that I obviously did not seem to understand.  It's a good thing that her quizes (there are 5 of them, and you get to drop one), midterm (1 of them), 3 papers, and Final are straightforward if you study the power point notes she hands out in class.  Acutally, if you get ahold of those notes, there's really no need for class at all...But, if you still think you oughta go, make sure to bring coffee and colored pens for dootling.  </div></div></div><br/>\n",

Dr. Algert has a lot to offer and really likes her nutrition and kinesiology students. I felt that she was fair ingrading and on the additional assignments it was not too difficult to get an A. Being that this is my field of study I participated a lot and made syre she knew my name and I think it paid off. Even if you need to take this class for GE I think she is a good professor to get for 210 because she cares that you know the information and she does not want to fail anyone.

It's intended for non-art majors so it should be relatively easy for any majors. Allebe is a sweet lady and she totally understands that this class is a general ed and will not destroy your grade. The Required book for this course is outrageously expensive and in my honest opinion useless since she goes over all of the things that are to be tested. There are just a few questions that the book goes over though. One nice thing about this course is that on the midterms she gives the students an opportunity for extra credit that can boost your grade up by 5 points! That could easily boost your B+ to an A- or A. There is also a really fun art project that is worth as much as the midterms. Attendence is also key if you want an A since she has a sign in sheet and has random writing assignments.\n",

Her tests aren't that hard--as long as you take notes, and go over the works (key themes, key passages) you will succeed.  Unfortunately, she is NUTS when it comes to how she grades papers. For our first draft she gave me a B (I have never gotten below a B+ on a paper), and then I tried to fix everything and ended up with a B- on the final paper!!! WHAT??! If you're a bad essay writer to begin with, I'd seriously consider going in to office hours LOTS before its due. That is what screwed up my grade, and I didn't get the A. Sometimes she did let the class dominate discussion too much, but it was refreshing to have SOME discussion as opposed to none.

      "Dr. Allen was a fairly new professor when I had her in the spring of 2007, and I don't think she had quite figured out how to structure her class. She seemed to be dominated by some of the students in the class, and was timid during lecture. Although it was apparent that she had a lot of knowledge and things to say about the reading material, she was unengaging and nervous. As a result, she spouted off large amounts of objective facts and dates rather than commenting on thematic elements of the texts. Her one midterm was extremely hard, writing intensive, and long. Her quizzes occured almost every class period, and were sometimes unclear. Finally, her paper expectations were extremely high, and the whole class was in shock when grades were returned. She means well, but needs to step back and figure out how to be more engaging and realistic with her class expectations.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

Yes, Dr. Allen does not go off on fun tangents, yes, Dr. Allen does not arrange her seats in circles. But, I learned more in her class than I did in the previous cores combined. Firstly, she tells you EXACTLY what she is looking for in all of her assignments/tests. It is impossible to do poorly if you follow her instructions. Secondly, she is extremely organized and has every lecture planned out. Some of you may not think this is a good thing, but it was actually a very refreshing change from the disorganization of the previous cores. Thirdly, Dr. Allen WILL make you a better writer. She gives a lot of feedback on both your paper and the essay part of the midterm. Basically, Dr. Allen truly cares about her students and works her ass off to make sure that they succeed. If you need help, go to her office hours and she is more than willing to answer any questions. The reading was a little dry, but Dr. Allen's enthusiasm for the time period made me enjoy it.

Facilitating discussion is not her strong point--she unnervingly takes note of when you speak in class so that she can accurately grade your participation--but her lectures are informative and interesting. Most impressively, she gave us a chance midway through the quarter to evaluate her, and then actually took those comments into consideration for the second half of the quarter.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Firstly: to the reviewer who said Allen \"will make you a better writer\"--I'm calling bullsh*t. There's a difference between \"hard\" and \"challenging.\" I've had professors whose classes were really tough but in the end I found their classes really rewarding (I'd rather get a B in a fulfilling class than an A in a dumb one). It is *hard* to get a good grade in Allen's classes (I've taken Core as well as 400-level with her), but even if you do you don't, in my opinion, get anything out of it. I'm especially disappointed in her as an upper-div Engl professor. ALL she cares about in essays is format format format. Since high school I've been taught to try and not be formulaic in my writing. By junior year as an English major I had become accustomed to teacher's grading my papers based on the content--my ideas, writing style, interpretations. But not so with Allen. After she took over a f*cking month return a very short paper I was very disappointed to see that almost all the comments were regarding minor errors in MLA format--the only praise she gave me on the whole paper was how I had formatted the heading correctly. And honestly, the amount of time it takes her to return a paper is terrible--I know this is a very common complaint among English departments, but her turn-around rate (for *short* papers) is the worst I've seen in a CLA teacher. And she comes off as hypocritical since she's very very rigid about late policies. It was extra frustrating at the end of the quarter, because my classmates and I wanted to see the feedback on our first paper before writing our final paper. I don't think I got that first paper back till dead week.\n",
      "I *do* appreciate that she's passionate and knowledgeable about her subject (18th cent lit) and *sometimes* she was really sweet, but I think she's sub-par as a lit-discussion-professor. I think she would be better suited to teaching a technical writing class (where she can fulfill her format fetish) and history class (where she can do her 18th cent history lectures). </div></div></div><br/>\n",

We turned in a paper week 5 that was not returned to us until midway through finals week, and were given 3 DAYS to expand it into a longer paper. Students told her how unmanageable this was, considering we also had a final that same week, and she decided to resolve this issue by offering to extend the due date of this paper into the summer. I may be wrong, but that certainly does not sound legal to me.

      "While I agree that Allen wasn't as organized as she could have been last quarter, she in no way deserves the hate she's getting. The quarter was clearly rough on her, as she was juggling home life, work life, and extra things, including heading a project to make the English department better. Yes, it would have been nice to get our essays back earlier, but she did her best with what was going on in her life and was extremely apologetic, especially if you actually made the effort to go in and talk to her. Her method of teaching the class was extremely clear, and her grading wasn't at all hard; she told us exactly what she would ask us and what to expect at the very beginning of the quarter and stuck with it the whole way through. To top it off, her dreaded quizzes have the same questions every time... And those that actually did the reading did very well on them (honestly, if you didn't want a lot of reading... Should you really have chosen English as your major?).\n",

This class was the absolute worst class I have ever taken in my whole entire life. Not only did everyone get F's on the first exam but she had to curve every single exam at least 20% and had to offer extra credit just in order for people to earn a passing grade or a D at that. I got a C+ and I am a student who has been on Dean's List four out of five quarters here. This class took more studying than I put in for Biopsychology (which was a LOT). So before you say, \"hey this looks like a breezy class for spring q!\" THINK TWICE. Do NOT take this class unless you want to court report every word spoken in lecture (since the class is 2 hours of discussion filled with random scribbled words on the whiteboard and random images on the projector-- which you WILL BE TESTED ON) and then in turn memorize every word you have written. The most unpredictable exams with passages where you have to point out every detail of that let me tell you are NOT easy to identify.

Her exam questions were oddly worded and hard to understand in many cases and she doesn't hand the exams back. She also had to curve every exam by 10% to make the highest grade 100% but never took an average of exam grades so a ton of people still had failing grades. Your best bet for doing well in the class is doing every reading and drinking a ton of caffeine to try to pay attention through her lectures, but I would recommend taking a different class if at all possible. She seems to have better reviews for other classes, so maybe it is just 230 that she sucks in, but just avoid her if you want to get a good grade.

It quickly became apparent the act of listening to Allen's lecture could be bottled up and sold as the next cure for insomnia. I tackled this challenge by playing Civ5 in the back of class, pausing once every 10 turns to look up and the board and confirm that nothing of importance has in fact occurred. The exams were pretty annoying but are doable if you go to class and write down the stuff she puts on the board. Reading the texts would probably help on the exams, but the passages are pretty niche so you'll be lucky if you remember that specific passage – better to know generally what happens in the story (i.e. read the Wikipedia Plot Summary right before the exam). She did give a 10% curve on each exam (since the high score was 90; she never told us the averages) and a +5% extra credit paper you can crank out in like an hour. She hasn't bothered to grade our 3 response papers yet so I don't know how harsh she'll be on them. Overall this class was pretty useless but definitely passable.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "I think the reviews on here are way too harsh.  Dr. Allen is a difficult professor but it is for a reason.  Her quizzes test your analytical skills and actually help you do better on her exams as they are exactly like part one of her exams. She is looking for critical analysis in participation and for people who thought a lot about the reading, something we should all be doing as English majors anyways. You can't be lazy in this class if you want to do well; close reading is essential to participating in discussion and learning in this class.  I'd recommend getting the glossary of literary terms as she emphasizes the use of literary terms on her exams and papers and you did to know how to define and recognize them.  The discussion in class was good but I think it could have gone a bit deeper, especially with the romantic poets we went over. I'd highly recommend taking this professor, it's a lot of work but you'll become a better reader and writer.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

I felt like I received the grades I deserved for every assignment and I found her very nice and easy to talk to. The lectures were very boring however, all you do is go over the reading material assigned and certain weeks it was a lot to handle with my other classes. That week she did cancel class once in order to help relieve the stress from that, which I don't think many teachers would do. Her absence policy did seem harsh though, if you miss more than 1 day it would result in a grade drop of 2% each consecutive time. If you take a lot of notes in her class, ask questions, and spend a good amount of time working on the essays you should do fine in this class.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

We come to class to only discuss the readings and it ends up being a class discussion that she adds absolutely nothing to. She just sits and listens. This makes it difficult to pick out what she wants you to write about on the tests and quizzes. You have to be able to interpret these writings on your own if you are to take this teacher. The format of the class is 10% comprehensive pop quizzes, 10% participation 35% 5-6 page paper, 20% midterm and 35% cumulative final. The structure of the quizzes and tests contain and excerpt from any of the stories, which you are expected to identify the author and title along with describing its context, thematic significance, and its artistic significance. The tests also contain a 500 word essay that counts for your GWR credit if you so choose. To be honest, if i didn't need GWR credit i would have dropped this class after the first day. She is also a very tough grader and counts off for any GWR mistakes throughout the course. In all, avoid this teacher, unless you want to have to figure everything out on your own.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

She basically expects you to be able to write like an English major and read about 50 pages twice a week. Extremely time consuming class for just a general ed class. If you are going to take this for USCP, C4, and GWR credit, you\\'re better off with taking an easier C4 class that\\'s also USCP and just taking the GWR test. She is an extremely hard grader, like previously said, and you are more likely to pass the GWR test than to pass the GWR in her class.

She is a very tough grader, especially on essays and papers, but I felt like she was genuinely interested in helping to improve my writing.

      "I had a lot of journalism experience before I took this class, but I didn't realize how much there was left to learn until I had her. She's awesome. She presents everything clearly. You know what is expected of you and she will help you improve and get it done. Don't skip class. Read the material and listen to the major points of the lecture and you should do well. The grade pretty much consists of a group project, a couple quizzes and stories, and a portfolio. I'd recommend this class and Teresa Allen to anybody.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "I feel bad for tarnishing Allen's 4.0 rating. I've actually taken her for both Copy Editing and Ethics and have walked away with mixed feelings. Copy Editing was, for the most part, not helpful at all. Lectures were disorganized, grading standards unclear, and she would sometimes come in exhausted and unprepared. It was an easy class requiring little work overall, but it felt like everything you actually did do was busy work. I wouldn't say my editing skills improved much. In Journalism Ethics, on the other hand, Allen was awesome. She seemed energized by the subject matter and was always prepared. Her lectures were meaningful and she put great stock in student discussion. It was also in the afternoon, so she actually seemed very alert. At the end of all this I can only assume 2 things. A) She doesn't enjoy copy editing at all, and B) She isn't a morning person. That being said, she and Soares are the only professors in the department that I believe really bring something to it. Ramos is arrogant, Murray unclear, and Munroe wastes your time. Sosna wasn't awful, but his lectures can be pointless. Long story short: Allen is imperfect, but a lot better than most. I'd recommend her, particularly for Ethics.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

The books were useless to read because she goes over everything you need to know for the tests (which she is horrible at grading, so go over your asnwers with someone else when you get your test back.. chances are you both had the same answer but magically one of you was wrong and the other was right).  The essays you write are not bad at all, they are pretty easy topics because by the time you get the prompt the            theme has been beaten into your head... and she is a fairy easy grader when is comes to the essays.

A lot of people just didn't understand AP style in my copy editing class, and it showed up on their tests so they were bummed. And then they ranted about how useless editing is. Boy, are they wrong.

So far, we haven't even had a midterm, although if we did I'm sure it would have been easy. There is absolutely no out-of-class work. Everything is done in class, which gives you something to do during the 3-hour block. She hates it when students are late, so don't be... even though she has been many of times. Truthfully, I've learned a lot from her and would definitely take her again. You won't be disappointed.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "On the first day I was a little leery of Professor Allen. She has a ball-busting, harsh reputation that definitely precedes her. I found this to be the complete opposite of her personality and teaching style. I loved Allen! Her class was actually really fun because the coursework was so light! There was reading of course, but a lot less than most classes. She shows a lot of videos and utilizes the multimedia approach to teaching. She was definitely an easy grader--except when it comes to essays. If you come to every class, do the reading and participate in class discussions, you'll definitely get an 'A'. Allen knows her subject matter, which made this class somewhat fun.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

She was probably the only good thing about that damned newspaper. I liked that she was into writing true crime and that she interviewed inmates in the CDC and Federal \"pound me in the ass\" Prison. She was tough and fearless despite her slight presence and demeanor.

      "Feature writing was a lot of work, and I didn't expect it to be, but I'm so glad I took this class. Teresa has very high expectations for her students and made lots of demands. At one point, the class was so stressed out that we asked her to push back a couple of deadlines, and she was completely understanding and willing to listen to the students. What a rarity! I can't say enough about Teresa as an instructor; she puts a lot of effort into sharing her knowledge, evaluating her students fairly and challenging her pupils. I feel like she's the only one in the journalism department who truly respects the students. My writing really improved with her help, and I was very satisfied with the articles I wrote for the class. And she's just plain cool; for our final we had a potluck in class and discussed our last feature and read our favorite writers. I would recommend this class to anyone, especially writers, but I caution that it's not a course for the average slacker. There are three big features due, reading and writing assignments each week and a few quizes. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

I learned this material in high school before.  My teacher in high school can teach better then him.  When he lectured, i just got confused because he gave details about a particular problem that is irrelevent at times.  yeah, he can draw lines very straight, but he is not straight in teaching the class.  He introduces a chapter very confusing.  all i did to get a C in the exam is study the book and remember what my teacher had taught me in highschool.  He doesnt curve.  I think he is a nice guy though.  It is kind of scary that he knows all his student's name.  i mean, i dont care whether a teacher knows my name, it is college.  come on, i will not see him again anyways.  if you are able to get PATTON, i urge you to get PATTON.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

Not a good method of teaching.  Yes, he is new to the school, so he is extremely unsure of what steps he can take within the math department or not.  He is a very nice guy, but that is really not important when it comes to math, because he never clarified my answers very well.  I took Kirk, the quarter after because I didn't pass with Alonji.

Professor Alongi is obsessed with making sure his students truly do understand what he is trying to teach, after every important point he makes he will stop and ask \"is it clear?\". He is a very nice guy and is always open to questions. One thing I would like to get straight is that I don't generally like math, but Professor Alongi actually made calculus class enjoyable (its sounds like an oxymoron I know) he has a great sense of humor and is not afraid to show a little enthusiasm when he is excited about something. However his class is not an easy calc class, I took Kirk for 141 and that was a joke. If you want an easy A then take Kirk or one of the other easy instructors, but if you want to actually learn calculus and not dread going to calc class every day take Alongi.  </div></div></div><br/>\n",

The class sped up a bit near the end, because the stuff was new.  When going over formulas he almost always proved them before writing them out, which is good if you like to undertand the concepts.  He was easy to understand and drew frightfully good pictures. (I've never seen anyone draw a perfect circle with chalk)  His quizzes were easy, but his tests were kinda tough.  You pretty much know what to expect on the tests though, so make sure you know how to every kind of problem.  I messed up on the midterm so I ended up getting a B.

Of course, they're usually the two problems you had lots of trouble doing.  Luckily, his tests and quizzes are worth far more, and he tries to bring problems out of the homework or cover them well in class.

      "i took alongi because i saw what a great polyrating he had, he is a really good teacher because you can tell he takes alot of the time to plan out his lectures while trying to make them interesting, and he presents them really enthusiastically, but i personally did not like his approach to teaching because i felt intimidated by his lectures when he would get so excited in a derivation and start screaming at us.  From then on i did not really feel comfortable approaching him, or maybe it is because i am a bit shy.  Many other kids said that he is a very easy approachable man.  But i was a bit biased about that because almost always made me late for my next class by always going 5 minutes after the hour doing more examples.  He does explain the material in detail, or as i think the LONG way of doing things.  but on the plus side he does many examples of each possible way so its pretty hard to not understand something. he is also VERY helpful duringn office hours. on a typical week you will do new material from monday through thursday and then will go over questions of friday and have a 10min quiz. if you like to know where many of the equations and theorums come from he is the perfect teacher to take, but get ready for a scream fest.  he has two midterms and he grades very fair.  the final was a bit difficult but study hard and you will do well. he assigns a good amount of homework everyday and collects it.  he is ANAL about showing work and just a bit OCD... he can draw perfect circles and incredibly straight lines. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Alongi is great!  He is such a math geek, but in this case it really helps.  The one thing about him is that he collects homework every single day, and if you stroll in 30 seconds after he has collected, too bad!  But that's just b/c he has shit he's gotta do, and doesn't like students interrupting him.  He is amazingly clear w/ his drawings, and really does have nice handwriting.  Of course, that led to just about every class going a minute or two past the bell, but it was well worth it.  I definitely overstudied for tests (but hey, I got the grade); they aren't that bad, but definitely not a cake walk either.  Overall, a great teacher who will make you work but, then again, what calc class doesn't make you work?  I highly recommend him.  </div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "A fantastic math teacher. His way of presenting the material is amazing. He has very thorough notes which he presents in a linear fashion, he'll then do an example and magically, you understand it. He also has very nice handwriting, this is helpful because I wrote about two pages of notes/equations per class. He didn't collect or grade homework, which is nice. The grade is determined by 3 out of 4 quizzes (he drops the lowest score), two midterms and a final. He's kind of a tough grader, but very fair. Pretty interactive with students, one time he was talking about buying another Chalk Holder and a student asked, \"Why do you need a second chalk holder?\" Alongi responded with, \"I already have two, I want a third.\" If I had to take any more math courses Alongi would be my first choice, even if it involved waiting a quarter for him to teach it (yes, he's that good).

That calculates to about 10% of the class grade.  1 problem on the final was worth 10% of the class grade.

She constantly judges students and often doubts their abilities...by the end of the quarter I don't think any students cared or respected her or her class.

      "There is truth in all of the prior reviews about Dr. Alptekin. Although, a few of them are more harsh than deserved. I agree that not all students are treated equally. Dr. Alptekin is unable to keep an open mind with (and listen to) people she has had disagreements with in the past. Dr. Alptekin cares deeply that her students learn, but I would encourage her to better seperate personal and professional issues on the job. I believe the grade that I received was fair considering that my other class (PolyHouse) dominated my schedule this Spring at IME 545's expense. However, I do have concerns in general about her \"fuzzy' grading system, especially considering the above-mentioned unequal treatment. IME 545 was a good course. We learned about the emerging research in simulation as well as completed a practical real-world simulation project. It's unfortunate that IME 545 takes place during Spring 545 when it must compete for time with PolyHouse and graduation requirements. Other than that, I recommend the course.   </div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Susi is fantastic. As an engineer, I didn't expect to get a whole lot out of this class, but I actually ended up really enjoying it, and it's pretty cool to be able to look around you and speak intelligently about plants. This class isn't incredibly easy; it has an average workload, and the tests are involved, but not unfair. The main homework initially seems kind of cheesy--you \"adopt\" a tree and write about it every week--but it's not a big time commitment, it can be nice to sit outside a bit, and the big project it leads up to really isn't that bad (you compile pictures and information about your tree into a PowerPoint slide). Susi is one of the best lecturers I've had. She's extremely clear and gets her point across really well. This class gave me the best explanation of photosynthesis I've ever had. Make sure you go to lecture because there are mini-assignments and quizzes. You should go anyway because if you do, and if you take good notes, you're likely to get at least a B in the class. I didn't have Susi in lab, but I'm sure she would've been good in that too. Check out the lab professor Fritz Light for more info on that.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

TaDA !!   if you attempt to think you will fail, if you attempt to try to work hard you will fail..... the key here if you do somehow get stuck in this class is to work as little as possible and make a cube.  i cant stress enough that he only wants a cube.  if you work had at a design it doesnt matter if it isnt a cube!! i think you see where i am going with this.  i hope no one ever has to take him again and if you have had him before please write more warnings so others will not take him too.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Amanzio's evaluations are really harsh on here. I didn't feel like it was as bad as people say, but I can see how people might misinterpret him.  See, he tries to let you solve your own problems and make them your own. And maybe after a few shots in the dark, he'll tell you how he's seeing the problem. Maybe he's right. In any case, take his POV for what it's worth.  Make it your own. Or make it right, if you see it differently. It's a little hard wondering what he's expecting, but I think he just wants your best. Granted, sometimes he won't hear things the way you intended them, but that can happen in communication. And it does get frustrating if all you're looking for is easy answers. His class is very computer based, so it's not for the digitally weak. He'll train you a little, and you shouldn't need more than what he gives you. Keep in mind that he does appreciate the ability to go from idea, to sketch, to computer... y'know? Don't take all the analog stuff you learned for granted. We are designers, and sometimes the computer is way too slow. I must say my glasses can be somewhat rose-colored when it comes to my teachers. Like I didn't think EDES 101 was so bad. And I did like Yip and Denel. So maybe I'm naive.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Joe is a very difficult person to read.  His instructions on a project are very unclear and when asked to clarify what he means he responds with a wry smile and \"what do you think I meant\" as if he is trying to be some smart-ass character from Fountainhead.  At the end of the qaurter review, he gives remarks that lend one to believe a good grade is in store.  However, my actual grade was lower than what I expected and what others in the class thought I deserved.  His approach to grade \"negotiation\" is frustrating.  His response is \"although you did work well enough to get an A, I gave you the grade you got because I get that feeling everyonce in awhile that the project is a \"B\" project.\"  I am baffled by his responses to students and his ability to relate to them (completely non-existent).

      "This is your basic english teacher with a pretty mundane curriculum which can make it tough to show up for class.  Most of the kids surprisingly had trouble gradewise.  She loves you if you can write coming into class and you will be rewarded with A's.  If you cannot write, she may be some help, but your grades will suffer.  Up until the book you read at the end of the year, the textbook she has chosen (I won't be surprised if she changes it) is TERRIBLE.  But anyway, try to get someone else if you hear they are easy, but overall she is pretty run-of-the-mill.

Three weeks out of the 10, we didn't have to go to the scheduled class at all, just meet with her privately for 20 minutes once that week.  Yeah, it was cool getting to miss all that class, but what was better was that during the conference she was ready to help you on an individual basis to improve your writing skills.  It was really helpful.  We also discussed current events in class a lot and that made it a lot more interesting.  The discussion was also a nice break from the usual lecture classes by giving students a chance to interact with each other and actively participate in the class.

      "Sherrie was a very good professor who could easily connect with students of several different technical areas.  This class starts out very rigorously and then slows down towards the end mainly because there is so much to learn in preparation for the individual and group projects.  She expects you to be on time like a business or else your grade suffers.  Your grade is based on participation, an intro memo, a resume, a tech translation assignment, an individual project, a grammar test, a proposal, a group final project report and presentation of it.  She may be intimidating by saying things like \"What do you think\" when you ask a question, but really it reinforce what you already know but couldn't think about.  Nevertheless, she is really hepful at office hours when you need help on your papers or if you are stumped on the assignments.  Lectures were all right and helpful depending on how you think about tech writing.  But mostly this class is about how efficient you work.  Overall, a good teacher with a great feel for different levels of technicality and work fields.  After all, this is supposed to be a freshman class for who knows how many majors, but most of my class were seniors ready to graduate.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "I can't speak for students in other classes, but if you take Ms. Amido for Technical Writing, GET READY TO WORK, and don't expect anything to come easy.  I consider myself a decent writer, probably better than most engineers, but I may end up with a C in this class.  Why?  Because Amido is very, very demanding, and is also a very stingy grader.  She runs the class like a business, and she is the CEO (oh yeah...she has issues with power too, but I won't get into that).  You have to give her memos all the time, and that's only the beginning.  Today I handed in a twenty-five page group report, I completed two 8-10 page papers earlier in the quarter, I completed numerous smaller assignments, and I read most of the chapters in the Technical Communication textbook.

I truly have a long (and difficult) road ahead of me before I am ready to work anywhere for anyone. Hopefully you won't feel the same way...</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Amido is really good at helping you with your resume and cover letter but much past that I don't feel she was very helpful.  Many of the guidelines she wanted the students to follow for the other projects were not very clear and I often lost points for things I didn't know she wanted us to do.  The other big problem with this class was the overall set up.  She rushed us into completing the resume and cover letter so they would be ready for the career fair but then it seemed like we did nothing in the class for the longest time besides the iFixit project which was not that much work.  But then in the last one or two weeks she gave us about 7 more projects and papers to do which was awful when I had other more important classes to deal with at the time.  She said she would be changing this format for upcoming quarters though so maybe it'll be better.  Overall I'd say she is probably a better bet than a lot of the other professors for this class because she will prepare you better for the workplace but I wouldn't advise taking her if you already have a heavy workload.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Amido was great. She is friendly with a no-bullshit attitude.  While this class is a lot of work, all of it is industry applicable. I now know how to write a memo, create a stand-out resume, conduct an interview, and write a professional research paper. At first I was not looking forward to the iFixit project, but it ended up being fun and is a great project to add to your resume. I would recommend taking this class as a sophomore or junior because you will realize the importance of this class for your future. Amido really stressed networking and putting yourself out there. Grades aren't the most important thing when getting a job; who you know and your communication skills are usually more important.

She then takes only the top 80% of the 160% and adds that to a 20% participation grade (which consists of quizzes, student initiated office hours, Q &amp; A's in class, etc.)  The reason we all fail some of the assignments is because she REALLY wants us to LEARN and in order to do that, we have to work at it.  Also, she grades on effectiveness, not effort.  This class teaches how to write business documents; if you don't know how to effectively communicate in the written form for your business, you could get fired.

If you're at all interested in becoming a better writer (everyone should be), you can't go wrong. Sherrie spent a long time in business doing the managing, hiring, and firing, so she knows her stuff. You'll notice she is a little rough around the edges, and she'll chastise you every once in a while for mistakes (whether they're in a paper or how you act), but she's actually a sweet lady and is truly trying to help you improve. Although there are a lot of assignments, I never felt they were overwhelming, and I actually enjoyed a number of them. Grading is strict (assignments are basically graded on how close to perfection they are, not how hard you tried), but a lot of your lowest grades are dropped. An A isn't easy, but the work is fantastic practice, and you'll learn a lot about getting a job and generally performing well in the workplace. On another note, class itself is pretty relaxed, and it's small, so you get to meet some other cool people who are probably in your major. Take 310 with Sherrie!</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Sherrie is a nice lady. Unfortunately, she is not an understanding person. She does not take into consideration other classes and responsibilities her students have when making assignments. She expects her students to know when assignments are due, even if those assigments are made due another day without notice. She gives feedback on assignments but does not give any positive response whatsoever. When you go to office hours be prepared to take an antidepressant because never once have I gotten a positive comment about my assignments from her, even after I revised them. Her portfolio assignment is a big part of the grade and it also could be just one class on its own. I have seen her several times for help, but she gives outlandish corrections. No student who is taking a full load of classes can expect to get an A on her assignments. Yah I understand that importance of doing assignments, but if every assignment can never be an A, then why should I want to do them. Please Sherrie take into consideration that students are students and that we have other classes we need to prepare for, not just yours. Also this A/B crap needs to stop because it is unfair that there is no grading rubric for any of the assignments and \"go read the book\" is not helpful when the chapters you refer us to dont even have \"acceptable\" information. She doesnt like \"duh\" factors, but explaining details of an industry when you are writing to people in that industry would be considered a duh factor by your colleagues.\n",

      "FSN 121 has always been known to be hard to get an A in. They recently switched the teacher to this guy, and he made it very easy to get an A in the class. Was he good at teaching? Not really. He kind of just rambles on and on at 7 in the morning. There is a lot of material in this class.. it is overwhelming because the tests are very specific. At the beginning of the quarter you get assigned readings which are SUPER long and SUPER dry. I stopped reading after the second week and found that I never really needed to know the material for any of the assessments. The class is composed of attendance, (if you go to lecture you get 10 points, for a total of 190 points), lab attendance (10 for each lab, total 90 points), online quizzes (70 points), 2 easy projects (80 points), a midterm (100 points) and a final (200 points). Go to every lecture and lab!! ten points a piece is worth it! This quarter he made the quizzes online, and even gave 2 attempts. The midterm was very specific, and required a lot of memorization. Everyone was freaking out about the final too because its cumulative and again a lot of info. The night before the final he sent us an email saying we could uses our notes (and our laptop with our notes), and the textbook. Would have definitely failed the final without it. He is usually a nice guy and you can tell he didn't want us to stress over this class too much. He made it as easy as possible this quarter, but i heard he changes things around each quarter. \n",
      "Although this professor is generally a pretty nice guy, he has a real temper. He's a different person in lab, and comes across as an arrogant chef. Several times he yelled louder than I could possibly describe at either one student, or a small group of students. It was intimidating, and extremely demeaning. The lab is fun but sometimes disorganized, and he gets mad if your group screws up or doesn't know everything he knows about cooking. He does fun chocolate, cheese, cake tastings and really wants us to enjoy the lab. It just would have been better if the students weren't so afraid of the fact that he could lose his temper at any moment. \n",

      "Honestly, Dr. Amin really is not that bad. If you pay attention in lecture or at least go over power points with an open mind the class is easy to handle and he doesn't ask a lot. Some people think his ego is large and his jokes aren't funny but it is called DRY humor for a reason people. Learn sarcastic jokes. And for goodness sakes, the man has developed countless amazing foods (such as the Hummus and Chocolate Ganache from Trader Joe's) so yes, I say he is allowed to think highly of himself. While he may not have all the answers in the world, as no professor does, he certainly knows a lot about food. Sure, his lectures aren't the most interesting and sometimes I, as a nutrition major, wonder why in the world I should know that a 13 week old chicken is called a \"Broiler/Fryer\", it is a class that will answer a lot of your questions like, \"why are carrots so orange?\" or \"why do proteins denature?\" For you FSN majors out there, you have to take the class anyway, so just keep an open mind and have fun! For those wondering if this should be your elective, ask yourself if you enjoy learning fun facts about food and if you like making/eating food. Yes, you get to make and eat food in lab. Good food. So don't listen to the negative things people have to say about this class, trust me, you will be just fine. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Dr. Amin brings lots of culinary and professional experience which helps enhance his lectures. There is a lot of material to cover, so there is a lot of information to know for each of the midterms. The readings are long, and there are maybe only 2 out of the 100 questions on the midterm from the book, so I did not find it worth it to read the book. Most of the information on the exams comes from lecture material. The exams are not difficult if you take the time to memorize the items he wants you to know from the study guide. Labs are fun, and you get to make a variety of dishes. If you come to class, go to lab, and go over the lecture notes in detail, you will do well in this class. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Samir Amin's class is not hard. Yes, the lectures can by dry, and he posts his slides on polylearn, but if you show up to lectures and take notes on what he says, It's pretty easy to do well. We had two midterms and I'm getting ready to take the final right now. I started studying for each midterm the night before and  got an 84 and an 86. He cracks really bad jokes which don't go over well (especially at 7:40 am). The only bad thing I would say about this class is that he doesn't quite have the test creating abilities to go along with the material he presents. I am usually able to recall or recognize everything on tests (If I don't know the answer I at least remember having seen it before), but there were a few questions on the midterms that I know he never talked about. But what's a question or two out of 150? \n",

      "He's also super understanding. My friend slept through the first hour and 15 minutes of class and showed up with 15 minutes left of class. Amin said not to worry about it and that she would be allowed to take the test an hour before our lab. Before his 6 hour lab block. Pretty understanding if you ask me. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

The first midterm was a slap in the face because I was acing the class and then got a C+... I went to his office hours and I went over the test and i only got his T/F questions wrong. Because his tests are so so so terribly written. \"Mature turkeys are primarily bought by restaurants\" is not an acceptable t/f question tf? Thank GOD I went to his office hours after the midterm because most of the t/f questions on the final were taken from the midterm and i just memorized them. Otherwise I wouldn't have gotten the B+ final and baaarely scraped by the class with an A. Surprising because I thought this class was an easy A! Anyways, another time he sucked is I went into his office hours I asked him to explain a part of the e portfolio website assignment given at the end of the quarter and he couldn't !!! just told me to do the alternative option and make a linkedin profile instead. like thanks for advising me to take the much easier route but but??? you should be able to explain your own assignment. also, this guy is a schmuck in lecture but a mean old man in lab. kinda scary!  </div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Overall this class is extremely dry, especially at 7:40 in the morning. Dr. Amin doesn't stray far off from the powerpoint slides and spends way too much time lecturing on portions of the class that are never on the tests and pretty irrelevant to the course (i.e the difference between round and flat fish). While it is clear he is extremely knowledgeable, he doesn't present the information in an exciting or scintillating way. Beware, you need a 95 or above to get an A in this class and the tests are very poorly written. The true or false are confusing and the questions extremely specific (i.e what is the age of a young turkey?). I would recommend studying the polylearn quizzes because I can almost guarantee that he just reuses those on the midterm and final. Finally, in the lab I found it difficult to approach him because of his rude and condescending attitude. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Amin's 121 is a 7:40 class, where you listen to the man read off the slides with a bit of bland excitement on his end. The lecture slides are very bland, but cover a lot of information that most likely you already know from a food service job (by having to take a food safe course) and common sense, and information that you will probably never use in your life unless you're becoming a chef. The lab is pretty fun because you get to eat the food, but if you have any food allergies/restrictions he doesn't really give a shit. None of the food is healthy, besides MAYBEEE the hummus, pita, and falafel dish, but even that is super oily and will leave you feeling stuffed (but I will admit it's super yummy!)  You make everything from scratch, so it is interesting if you like to cook at all.  There are quizlets online to study with for the midterms and final, so getting an A should be fairly straightforward. Also, each class if there isn't enough attendance, he offers a \"socrative quiz\" for extra credit for the students there, where he might ask you what day it is or what color is the sky or whatever just to reward you for coming to the bland lecture. Amin is also very opinionated when it comes to eating meat and gluten and dairy and gelatin, etc. so if you ask about vegan options or gluten-free options, he will probably shut you down. Not the healthiest of men:) but he is nice if you pay attention and seem interested!</div></div></div><br/>\n",

He gave practice midterms for the first two midterms but when I asked if he was giving practice problems for the final he looked at me like I was a complete moron, and then proceeded to tell me that nobody he knows gives practice anythings for the final.  Although every other teacher I've ever had here at Poly gives at least a study guide.  The guy is pretty no no nonsense but to the point where its rude and harsh, rather than encouraging.

Many other students had trouble completing the exams but if you know the material they are pretty easy.

      "Alrighty here's the low down: he sucks. First off, he actually doesn't have any clue what he's talking about. \"Learn By Doing\" should be to apply the topics you learned in class to real life applications. Nope. For him, it's finding what laws are for what topics without him knowing anything for it. Secondly, he has not lectured once in this class. \"How can that be?\" you ask. He brings in guest speakers. Every. Single. Time. Third, he grades for completion and attendance. Not really complaining about that, but when we have to show up to class and do absolutely nothing while he tries to be funny and and outside of class put an insane amount of hours into a project and then he says \"oh at first I was grading for completion and then I was going to go back and read it for accuracy, but i just didn't have time\" is really frustrating. Have not learned one useful thing in WVIT 423. You can tell he does not want to be there and that he is 100% not qualified to teach this class. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

His lesson plans depended entirely on guest speakers, who were dry and often relayed the same information. There were no tests, quizzes or challenges of any kind. If you're looking for an easy A, he's your man, grading entirely based on attendance. If you actually want to learn something, avoid taking classes from him at all costs. The class I took was Wine Law and Compliance, a required course for my major, and one that I was looking forward to. He truly did the students in my class a disservice.

He also is the only teacher I have ever had who seemed as if he didn't know the material he was teacher. On one occasion we spent ten minutes trying to point out a mistake he made during a calculations and when we finally got him to see it be brushed it off like the assumption he made we should take for granted even though it was wrong! He was also surprised by something he saw on the periodic table and he said \"In my 3o years of chemistry I have never seen that before\" but we had all known about that particular quirk on the table since high school chem!

      "Anariba is an OK professor, but there was nothing really that special about his class.  He lectured directly off of slides.  Also he did provide a fair amount of test prep material to the class via blackboad, but people would continuously find errors in his solutions and questions throughout the quarter.  Consequently, there were several emails throughout the 10 weeks of him apologizing and correcting himself.  Though he's a smart guy, I honestly put more trust in his TAs if I wanted a question answered.  Those things aside, there is 1 big thing that bugged me the most about his class.  On several occasions Anariba would delay quizzes - during one instance 10 minutes before we were supposed to take it.  He forgot to print them.  These delays added up and we ended up taking our last (3rd) midterm on the final day of lectures.  This eliminated all chances for us to have a review day.  I additionally, he certainly wasn't someone who people could look up to as an expert.  During one of our last weeks, while going over the basics of organic chemistry, he professed to almost failing o-chem himself.  What if you were flying in a plane and heard the captain say over the PA that he didn't do too well in flight school.  Gee thanks...</div></div></div><br/>\n",

Yes, it is a joke class and you can sit on your electronic devices the entire time, and do absolutely fine. However, you go to Cal Poly to get a higher education. He teaches you things that I could teach my eighth grade sister in an evening. If you are truly fascinated by finance, and want to learn the ins and outs of this concentration, avoid Bing Anderson at all costs. Otherwise, if you're looking for a high school level class, this is the one for you! I took him for Global Financial Institutions and Markets. We never once referenced the books.

But there just isn't a whole lot to the class - he needs to bring more material to the table. Midterm - 25 easy MC questions about weird facts you have learned. There's a really easy 15 page report paper on a financial institution of your choice and a straightforward 30 minute presentation where you can definitely read your notes.

      "Professor Bing does not know how to clearly teach a class. First of all, don't buy the book because you won't open it once. Secondly, he reads off his slides in the most monotone voice and most students simply don't pay attention. He grades attendance and participation, and you will get extra points for every time you answer a question. The reason why I am rating him so low (even though I got an A) is because he is so incredibly inconsistent and confusing. I got a C- on the midterm and probably a B on the final but a 108% on my group project and probably an A in participation. He tries to explain this weird curve he does as well, but basically you will stress the whole quarter thinking you are failing and then pass. Take him if you do not care about the content of this class and simply worry about your grades because in the end, you will probably do fine but come out knowing nothing. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Idc what any of these nerd above me are saying, take this class. It really couldn't be any easier for someone trying to fulfill their international business requirement while at Cal Poly. There is one midterm, 32 questions all MC. All the material for the test is located somewhere in his Power Points, which he posts on Polylearn. You also have a group project that spans the duration of the first half of the quarter. The project is just a group paper (couldn't be easier) followed by a 30 minute presentation WEEKS after you turn the paper in. The presentation is the most laid-back thing ever. You can use however many notes you want and don't even have to wear a suit. My group got over 100% on it and hadn't practiced or finished the powerpoint until an hour prior to class. The final is also less than 40 questions with barely any new material. The only pain about this class is that you have to go to class because he takes attendance and that counts for your participation, which you need to get an A, BUT, you can do whatever you want in class basically as long as you aren't interrupting him. I usually used lecture time to catch up on other homework or watch whatever basketball/football game I was betting on that evening. Bing is super nice dude and just wants his students to pass a required course. If you want to take an international business class because you, \"want to learn something,\" then you're a nerd and need to reevaluate your life!

To all the people that say it's hard to pay attention, I think he's hilarious, in like a 'tiny asian man chugging cough syrup all the time' kind of way.

I was still able to walk out with B's with about 30-45 min of studying for each midterm but each one gets progressively harder and the final requires knowledge of random concepts that you have to dig somewhat deep for in the chapters. I feel bad for Bing in a way, but hes also kind of frustrating because he just sits there and goes over some extremely boring material.

I was dissapointed in that I did not learn as much about International Finance as I wanted to, mainly because of the style of learning. He has one midterm, a project and a final. The tests were all off of the powerpoints - the project was the only real learning tool in the class but it was still not enough. If you are looking for an overview of International, you will get it with Han, but if you really want to understand it and know the material, consider finding out more first...</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Bing is a nice guy who really wants to help students. This is a really complex subject matter and you really got to put some time in to understand what's going on. He assigns a case, homework, has a midterm (ALL off power point notes) and a crazy-hard final (like essays and derive a formula we use... so hard). He's helpful in office hours and I know for a fact he curved the class, but how much I don't know. I don't know who else is a great instrucotr for 433 but Bing is pretty cool and if you care about learning the material and are willing to do a bit of outside work it's not a big deal to take him.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "433 is a tough class which covers a LOT of material in a short period of time.  Han is very attentive to the students' needs and is always willing to help answer questions during and after class hours.  If you are looking for another class that will help you bullshit and schmooze your way through college..take someone else.  Like most things in life--you get back from this class what you put in, i.e. not studying = not a good grade.  I am no genius, but I did get an a with a fair amount of effort.  Do the reading BEFORE the class meeting to get the most out of the discussions that take place in class, this way the material will be more familiar and you can actually participate in the discussion (learn by doing, etc.).  If this is done, a mere 3-4 hours reviewing the slides before the midterm will be enough.  If you don't keep up on the reading, however, be prepared for a stressful finals week because nearly ALL material covered during the quarter will be on the final.  He has a charming personality and he's really funny!  He is a fair professor...chances are you will get the grade you deserve.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "I received an A in this class--but I definately worked for it.  Han is obviously intelligent and very well educated professor.  His midterms and projects tie very well into what we are learning in class.  Expectations are clear and grading is very fair.  He has a fat curve at the end (doesn't factor in the genius who aces the test, etc.).  This guy is super funny and cheerful; always willing to help at random times, like at 1am the night before our crazy project was due.  My best advice:  DO the project for yourself, even if someone in your group does all the work for it.  If you understand the concepts in the project, you will get a good grade on the final. Keep up on the reading and review the slides before class...it makes a HUGE difference.  TAKE BING!</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "I took this class because it sounded interesting and multiple people had told me understanding international finance would be a good skill to have in the future. I also heard Bing was a pretty easy class. The first midterm came pretty late in the quarter and the average was a C-/D+ which made everyone panic. The highest grade was a 90% (only 1 A total). Most people were at a C-F. We then had a case study that everyone got an A on and then the final rolled around and if you went to his office hours he really helped. All the stuff on the exams came from his slides, but it was tough to understand his slides because he would write stuff everywhere. A lot of people came into this class thinking it would be easy because it was Bing, but he were surely mistaken which reflects the midterm grades. If you prepare better for the first midterm it isn't that bad of a class and I confidently know the basics of international finance pretty well. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Two midterms 15% and 25%, and a final 35%. Participation 10%. Homework 10%. Reading Research Papers 5%. I have not taken a class this horrible in all my time at Poly. Bing is an intelligent guy, but I don't think he was made for teaching. Just take a look at the grade breakup. The first Midterm is on the second day of class and is worth 15% of your grade. I still don't understand why we were tested before we ever learned anything in class. I know it was based on things that we are already supposed to know, but its just awful that its done considering that he is the only person teaching it the entire year. What is a student supposed to do if he screws up on it? Retake all his prereqs? What is even worse is that we spent the first half of the quarter going over present value and the valuation of bonds. Why test us on the second day of class, then spend half the quarter teaching something that you already tested us on?  It was a setup for failure for many people. The lectures are dry, but that isn't the problem. The problem is that he has trouble communicating the concepts of what we're learning. He pretty much reads off his power point slides. I realized half way that things were much clearer when I spent time reading the book. His lectures just killed my interest. The book is very good but is very dense with information once you get a few chapters into it. If you don't understand the first read through, don't give up. Just keep going over it again and again. I didn't get some things until the third try. There are only about five practice problems per chapter, not much for a \"learn by doing\" kind of school. The participation points is a waste of time because people rarely knew the answers, and the worst part is that he rewards mediocrity. Its OK to give points when people are wrong when they made an effort, but people were seriously making sh*t up. If you want participation points, just blurt out a number and your sure to rack up the points regardless of how off you are.  </div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Anderson is a good lecturer and explains the problems and student's questions well, but I personally REALLY didn't like his grading system and tests. One MAJOR PROBLEM I had with this class is that he DOES NOT allow an equation sheet of any kind so you basically have to memorizes a billion equations for the tests instead of spending that time to learn the material and theory behind solving the problems, etc. Participation is 10% and is just a bonus for those stupid people who love to talk in class and penalizes everyone else. Midterm 1 is 15% and was on the second day of class and was on all past material and pre-reqs which basically punishes you for not remembering material you took 2 years ago. He doesn't assign very many problems in the homework which is hard for people like me who need to do a bunch of examples before I absorb the material. The second midterm was okay, but he even admits that he likes to put \"tricks\" in his exams, but for the most part the exam problems were similar to the ones we did in class and in the book. Tables, graphs were copied from the book and he would ask you questions on them. The final is what I thought was completely misleading. He said it would be \"heavily weighted on the newly learned material\" however, 12 out of 30 of the questions were from the first midterm. The average in our class was 13 out of 30 which shows that people were completely caught off guard. I just think it's retarded to test people twice on the same material and just barely on the new material learned especially when professors explicitly tell you that they will test mostly on the new material, but I know most professors love to pull that crap on the final. The only good thing is that there is a huge curve at the end of the course which is why I got a B- and not like a D if it wasn't curved.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

His first test was really hard because he didn't really teach us anything but it really forced the students to review the prerequisite that they will need for the class. This second midterm was not hard at all, if you studied his powerpoint slide, reviewed the homework, you should be fine. The final was kind of a surprise but there was a few questions from the previous midterm. If you actually pay attention in class and understand what he tried to emphasize, you will be fine.

He is a very nice guy and wants to help you as much as he can, not to mention he is incredibly smart but he is not a great person to convey the material. To summarize everything I will list the pros and cons of this class. Pros: he is very nice and has lots of office hours before midterms and finals, the first part of the course is alright and relatively able to keep up with the material if you are good at math, and there is a huge curve at the very end. Cons: The second half of the class (after the first midterm) prepare to be totally confused and make sure you read the text thoroughly to understand the material, the final is very hard and you will fail no matter how much you study (still study though), if you are in a very smart class it will be harder for you to get a good grade because the curve is sorta messed up. Good luck as this class is unavoidable because Bing is the only guy that teaches it but don't stress too much if you work hard you will get a B, if you are really smart and the rest of your class isn't you will get an A. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

You probably cover 50 long and complex equations and he expects you to memorize all of them with no cheat sheet. It\\'s insane. His justification is that everyone should understand how the equations are derived and hence it should be easy. I had an A going into the final. I studied like crazy. I got a 15/32 on the final, and sadly that was higher than what other members of my study group received. This is more of a cramming class, than a learning class.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "The class overall was ok. The grade this quarter was determined by 2 projects, one midterm, one final, and participation. The work load is virtually non-existant because he does not grade homeworks. The pace of the class is very slow until the first midterm and then the pace accelerates ridiculously. To keep up and remain on top of things for the class, I recommend doing all the examples in the text and the problems in the back of the book. The answers to the problems at the back of the text are provided on his website. You'll probably be doing these problems over and over because Professor Anderson does not create problem sets for you which is a major reason why this class gets difficult. There are simply not enough examples or problems to sufficiently review the concepts and practice the techniques for calculations. The class notes can be ambiguous at times and some concepts that he covers for only 3 minutes in class will be on the test. Make sure you review his slides before the exams. The projects are not too bad. He will help you if you ask so don't worry if the projects are confusing. The textbook itself is pretty tough to read because it is not a regular textbook and was made as a review for people already in the finance industry. However, be persistent and read and understand the concepts presented in the book because all the examples he uses are directly from the text. We covered five chapters over the course of the quarter which may seem like very little, however, by the end of the quarter, you'll be glad its only five chapters because the material in the last two chapters covered can be very confusing. Professor Anderson is an satisfactory teacher. He presents the material to emphasize how to do the calculation but does not include as much theory and intuition behind the calculation which makes understanding the concepts difficult. I am not a fan of his teaching method because he bases all his class examples on those in the text. This is not helpful because we already have so little examples to work with to understand the concepts. If Professor Anderson was able to create problem sets for students, this class would be more helpful in teaching the subject.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

Don't get me wrong he is a nice guy, and also smart. I'm currently taking the CFA and am finding that although I got an A in the class, I pulled nothing from it.

His first midterm is primarily based upon his project. Cheat sheets are allowed. I really messed up by not writing down how to do the first project on my cheat sheet. I really wanted to take international finance this past quarter, but I saw that he was teaching it and decided against it.

      "Frankly, Bing Anderson is a lazy professor. He will not lift a finger, he will not stand (he writes on his computer which is projected on the board), and he will not even present without his microphone because he is too lazy to speak up. Besides his lazy teaching preferences he completely fails at preparing you in Finance. He focuses on the minutia of algebra and will literally spend 10 minutes writing out a 12 year NPV formula in longhand which takes about 4 seconds to solve with your financial calculator. His homework assignments are a complete joke, his first midterm is the easiest thing ever, he passes out teaching evaluations the first day they go out (week 7) and then his class completely changes. He starts running off these extremely difficult topics and breezing through months of material in 2 weeks. He does not explain how things work and he does not put it in context of the financial world; he only focuses on the adding and subtracting and basically everything you already know how to do. His final exam is impossible. It is all multiple choice scantron (like the midterm) but there will be groupings of questions that build off of one another and so if you miss the first one, you miss 9 more questions after that. He does not care about you or about finance. All he cares about is putting in his minimal effort, but \"covering his bases\" in the end of the quarter. I feel bad for the professors who have to teach courses that build off of his because they basically have to give you a crash course in what he was supposed to teach on top of their own subjects. But of course he is so tenured that nothing will get him out and clearly he has no motivation to work a little more for his students.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

If you are trying to learn anything avoid him at all costs.  His focus is to put in the least amount of effort humanly possible. He won't stand, he won't speak up (he uses a mic) and he won't teach.  The first midterm will be the easiest thing you've ever taken.  Know arbitrage and you'll ace it.

      "The first thing you will notice about Bing is how slow everything he does seems, and this is not limited to the class as a whole. If you go into this class after Gorman, prepared to spend the first few weeks of class wondering why you're there, as he spends about ten minutes making one single pint and then goes through five plug-and-chug examples if it is a simple formula. However, this pace also becomes a saving grace in the unlikely event you come across a topic that doesn't click right away or miss a class (not recommended, as there is a participation grade, half of which is based solely on attendance). Copies of the powerpoint which he lectures off of are sent to students after class, although taking your own notes is advisable as it lets you almost entirely bypass the relatively dense reading. The course is split into sections based on the first four chapters of a comprehensive book on fixed income securities, which is far thicker than those first four chapters. As such, the class does not adequately cover the material which one would assume it would. As the course progresses the material becomes harder to grasp and the pace slightly picks up, which leaves many students dazed by the final exam.\r\n",
      "Homework is limited to two assignments which are titled \"projects\", while practice problems to work through on your own are not provided at any point. These are very important, as they make up a significant portion of the grade as well as being comprised of similar calculations which make up a chunk of the exams, something Bing even warns the class about and makes a point of upon returning the \"projects\" or being asked for help on them.\r\n",
      "Both of the two exams are short and multiple choice with some quantitative questions that build on each other (and are none the less out of order) and some independent concept ones. This means no partial credit and that each question is worth a lot of points. A cheat sheet is allowed, although you should know the material well so that you can be prepared for curveball questions.\r\n",
      "As far as helpfulness, Bing is not very good at answering conceptual questions, but will provide you with directions on how to solve a problem is asked for help. This is good for your grade, but not so much for your understanding of the topic, which you are left on your own to find.\r\n",

      "After three quarters of German with Graf, I think I might understand German grammar better than I understand English grammar (and I'm an English major).  The way he teaches the language is completely logical and perfectly paced, aka nothing like what your high school spanish experience probably was.  You'll walk away having learned a lot while having the most fun you might ever have in a college class.  This class is what you make of it; you can either skate through an easy, light work-load quarter and then cram for the final, or you can put in work throughout the year (as is necessary anyway to actually get a good grasp on speaking and understanding a language), and the quizzes and final will be a breeze.

However, he gives us ABSOLUTELY no vocabulary to supplement this learning, and allow us to actually form sentences. He does not give us a single vocabulary list, almost no worksheets, and teaches none of the basic conversations you go over dozens of times in high school language class (ie: Hello, my name is _____ , what is your name? / My name is ______ / good to meet you/ likewise. How are you doing? .... ). Even though these basics can be frustrating by their elementary level, I believe that learning these basics are ESSENTIAL for understanding the language. \r\n",

He is compassionate and helpful during office hours, responds quickly to e-mails, and interacts with students in class, making sure they understand the important things. Your grade in the class basically consists of quizzes and participation; he assigns homework for us to practice what we are learning in class, but does not collect it. As long as you come to class, read his book (he wrote it himself--it's outstanding), and do the practice problems, you will learn... the few people who left bad reviews probably didn't do the homework.

      "Dr. Anderson was a great professor.  He didn't take himself or the course too seriously - in a good way.  By this I mean that he helped students understand the important concepts of the course, and he wasn't nit picky about forms.  Dr. Anderson always tried to find the easiest way for us to get things done, which is nice for a change.  It showed that he cared about us getting frusterated.  Sometimes he did seem rushed when I would ask him questions, but he always stayed to help.  His tests were challenging, but definately on par with the course.  The grades were evenly spread around the high 70s to the low 80s with a good proportion of A's and B's.  I believe that I could have done better if I had studied more than just one to two days in advance of the tests.  He also tells stories once in a while to break up the monotony, uses great real-life examples and lets the class out a bit early when there isn't anything more to say on a topic.  Overall, a great professor.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

He is also just a great person: fair, nice, understanding, helpful.  You can also look foreward to stories like when he saw a student on campus (when he was teaching somewhere else) and they started drinking together, after sharing 2 pitchers with the guy he realized he had a class to teach, so tought it drunk.  There's an even better one about how some studens switched his water bottle with one filled with vodka and he took a big swig, but was clever enough to not even flinch.  He then surveyed the class to find the people with amazed looks on their faces, thus catching the culprits.

      "As someone who has taken this course over again, I can say that he is really a damn good professor.  There is no homework but about a quiz a week which in total counts for 20% of your grade.  He drops your lowest quiz score.  Because there is a quiz, you have to study every week so when test time comes around you don't stress as much because you have already seen all the material and types of questions plus he doesn't try to pull fast ones on you by talking all concepts and spending no time on problems, then testing you all on problems like some other teachers who teach finance.  He thoroughly balances concepts and problems and then tests you accordingly.  Don't get me wrong, this class is no cake walk but James is the best teacher to learn from.  He makes sure you get it while teaching helpful everyday applications of finance and not just for those whose concentration is finance.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

Anyway, I am an accounting concentration obviously, and I DO think that the information will stick. He doesn't allow a cheat sheet, but that's really better in the long run since it makes you really memorize the material. True, he let us out early sometimes, but not often, and I felt I learned a lot from this class, and that he was a fantastic teacher. All in all, I recommend him, though he is not an \"easy\" A.

      "Prof Anderson is pretty much the coolest/nicest/FUNNIEST prof that i've had at cal poly.  However, his teaching style is not as cool.  his lectures are super funny and super entertaining but he does not teach concepts very deeply in his classes.  rather, he expects you to teach yourself from the book and then he will review the assigned problems with you in the class.  some of you may thrive on this, but for others who expect lectures to be helpful in learning material, Jimbo's not the guy for you.  A great thing about Prof Anderson is that he lets you out of class early pretty much every day and he's a super easy grader.  If you have trouble with the material, he is very available in his office hours and is a good teacher then; plus he's very accessible with appointment times.  In his office hours, it seems as though he does what he should do in class.  Bottom line, if you take him and get confused in any way, talk to him outside of class and he'll get your mind right.  Take Anderson if you have a good grip on accounting already, if you do, you'll LOVE him and the class.  If you are just a beginner and are trying to get a handle on the subject, you may want to go with a more thorough lecturer.  You gotta give it to him though, he's a damn funny guy and will often times make you laugh out loud multiple times in one class period.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

I do not believe that anyone in our class that showed up on a regular basis and put out a minimal effort got any less than a C.  Her exams are a little out of control.  If you ever have had Locassio for an ME class it is about the same thing.  She lays everyone to waste then scales it from there.  The topper is that she's pretty fine for an Engr. instructor.

      "Trisha fucking sucks asshole. First, she tells us half way through the quarter that we should be keeping up with Excel homework with another professor because it is a portion of our grade. What bitch doesn't tell us that we have a assignment with another professor throughout the quarter. Second, her homework policy sucks, she fucking doesn't give a shit if you spend 6 hours on your homework and get a 85 or 90, her grading policy gives you a F if you don't get a 100 on all homework, which she tells us halfway through the quarter. Third even though we run out of time she pushes a quiz into 20 minutes on the material we learned like 10 minutes ago, what fucking professor does that. Fourth, the professor tries to be funny in class talking about her sons but no one laughs because she just wastes class time. Overall, she looks mean when you first see her, doesn't have a smile on her face and is always angry looking, would not take her again.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Professor is really nice, she knows her stuff because she's been an accountant for a while. Lectures can go a bit fast, but if you read the book beforehand and do the homework before it's easier to understand. Some quizzes, a couple tests, the homework, and group work consist of most of your grade, along with an excel additional \"class\" online. I think accounting is just one of those things, like math, that you either totally get, or totally do not understand - if you're part of the latter group, I'm sorry. I personally thought it was a great class, and I learned a lot from it, and Trisha is a good choice for the class. She was taking her own college classes while teaching, so she understands us as students. Cal Poly alumnus, so that's kind of cool. She really loves sports, so you can relate with her with that. Apparently she also drives a motorcycle, so she's a badass ;) Gonna take her again for BUS 215, overall good professor. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "I have loved Trisha's class this quarter and highly recommend her for anyone taking BUS215. This class does require work outside of class but it really isn't that bad. She powers thru lectures for a reason: she wants us to work out problems in class so we can actually learn and apply the material in one class period. If you are someone who relies on lecture notes, I wouldn't take this with her, but the truth of it is you cannot learn the material in this class by taking notes. Trisha forces us to work out the problems, but it makes the midterms much easier because of this. She posts everything we need to know online which makes studying simpler. The class breakdown is two midterms = 33%, HW/Excel projects/Participation = 33% (easy points), and final = 33%. Do not be scared by the reviews before this, she is a super helpful teacher and this is an easy A/B as long as you put in an hour of work a week.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Trisha's class is a pretty easy A/B. She goes through the lectures within 30 minutes of class and then passes out a handout that lets you apply what she went through to problems. However, sometimes what is on the powerpoints is super easy and basic and then the handouts are very tough. If you can figure out the handout problems, you will be fine for the midterms and final. There are two midterms, a final, two excel projects, and occasional homework. The homework is turned in online through the textbook program and she expects you to have the rights answers in class the next day for participation points. The two excel projects are very easy but she grades hard on presentation so most people no matter what lost at least 1 or 2 points out of 20. The two midterms were not that bad but her final was very difficult. She had a few problems taken exactly from the midterms (which she doesn't let you keep so to review you have to go to office hours) and then a few problems that were very difficult and unlike anything she went over. Overall, you don't have to do much work for this class. Just an hour or two of homework the night before each class and then a day or so for the exams and getting a B is easy. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Trish was one of my favorite professors ever. She does fly through her lectures, but she always posted the PP slides and the information was straight out of the textbook, so if you read the chapter prior to class, you already understood most of what you were going over. The midterm had one giant problem about finding an individual's taxable income and what they owed that the majority of the class missed. So the next class period, Trish went over the problem in great detail, then issued the class the same problem but with different numbers and offered 10 extra points on the midterm for those who got the new problem correctly. My midterm went from an 88 to a 98. The tax return project is very difficult, but she will check all your answers and tell you which numbers are wrong. The final is open book. She really gives you every opportunity to succeed. Love her!</div></div></div><br/>\n",

Trish is committed to having lots of office hours; she even had a \"pizza party\" at her house on a Sunday to help students with the tax problem. For the final/midterm, she's in her office a day before exam for a good three hours - great time to ask about anything you need to know. She doesn't give tricks on exams (like I mean Clayton Kershaw curveballs), but the exams will challenge you. However, with proper studying habits, you will be fine. I got A's on everything (I don't know about final) but I am really sure I ended up with an A in the class. Take her for anything (214,215,320, etc.). She is great!</div></div></div><br/>\n",

For some reason, she's been constantly canceling class this quarter and wasting time in class so we are waaaay behind schedule than we are supposed to be. Tax is supposed to be a subject that's open note and all other professors do so but she has us memorize everything which is difficult for a lot of people. She's really behind everything and her scheduling is off; she tells us that she's going to post our homework assignments on polylearn on the weekend but she ends up posting them in the middle of the week and makes them due in 2 days. This would've been a much better class had she taken it more seriously instead of going off and doing her own thing and going on tangents all the time in class.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Ginny is a wonderful teacher, not only because of her great attitude, but also because she can effectively teach the history of theatre. This class does have a bit of reading, about 8 book chapters and 4 or 5 plays, but this isn't too bad because quiz and test questions are based mostly from the reading. Tests are fairly easy if you keep up with the reading, but it is possible to do poorly if you don't study. There is also a group project that you work on the entire quarter, but it isn't too bad because it's spread out over many weeks. I'm an engineering major who had to take a theatre class for a GE, and it went really well. I would not recommend this class to anyone who absolutely hates theatre or hates to read, but you really can't get out of that for C3 GE. On another note, she encourages class participation and is very chatty with the class, but she hardly ever calls on people to answer questions; she relies on volunteers. I'm really shy, but never worried about having to speak, and when I did, she genuinely listens and gives extremely constructive feedback. Take Ginny for theatre!</div></div></div><br/>\n",

However, Ginny's electrifying personality and willingness to present material in an interesting way quickly paved out the nervousness.  By the end of the quarter, that class became my favorite.\r\n",

      "This quarter was my second class taken with Anderson-Cain, and for good reason! She is such a nice and sweet woman and she is so understanding. She understands that SPAN 103 is still a beginners course so her expectations are not extremely crazy. She speaks in Spanish the entire class but will clarify in English if her students look like deer in the headlights. She's always open to extensions if needed on essays and she's very understanding of absences if doctors notes are provided. You take a Chapter test every other week consisting of only the one chapter's material, the tests consist of an oral section, fill in the blank, multiple choice, short answer, lecture comprehension and then an essay typically at the end. You write two essays over the course of the quarter, both aren't over a page in length, the third composition is just a revision of the first essay. Final consisted of a typical test format, no longer than usual, and then an oral interview that was conducted the week before finals where you show up to class in pairs to answer 3 questions and then you get to be done with class until the final! She is such an awesome professor I would 10/10 recommend taking her course. Such a sweet professor and a really stress free but beneficial class!</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Well, if you have never taken a Spanish class before- RUN. I fortunately took six years before her class ( a required one for my major) and it helped a lot. It's supposed to be an introductory class, but she starts day one by teaching in Spanish. How is anyone who doesn't know Spanish supposed to learn what you are saying? They didn't. Some people I know without previous experience got D's because she made it too difficult for them to understand what was being taught. Also, more importantly, besides introducing the basics of the language to students, she was supposed to give our class terms we could use in the agricultural world. It says it in the description for crying out loud. We never learned ANY kind of Agribusiness terminology the whole quarter; she said at the end she'd send out an email with a list of useful terms.... DIDN'T happen. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Also... Rosetta Stone. I have nothing against the program except that it is boring and expensive. $90, for just the quarter (and that's with a student discount). She really likes it and expects you to put hours into it every week. If you have her, register as early as possible. Any complications and you're screwed for the quarter. Mine didn't register properly, along with some other students and we ended up starting late halfway through the quarter. It killed my A, I had 98% and not participating as much in that program dropped it to a B.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Besides that, she makes classroom participation really easy, and it can be a relatively fun class, if you know Spanish already. She also does a good job with the Hispanic culture portion. The tests are directly what you learn in class and do for homework, so they are easy to study for. OVERALL, I'd say try and get any other professor for this particular 111 class, she's really nice, but not a right fit for Spanish 111. If you know Spanish though, you CAN do really well in the class.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "She's very nice, but I really didn't want to be there. I couldn't test out of it, but I can't complain too much because it was an easy A. Participation and attendance are worth like 10%, so just show up and say anything (sometimes people spoke in English lol) and you'll get credit. The tests are 25% of your grade (there are three) and are mostly grammar, but use some flashcards like an hour before the test just to get the vocab down because there's always a section about that. They take like thirty minutes max and then you get to leave early. There were three in-class essays (worth 15%) that always were about the current chapter, but you don't actually need to know any of the cultural aspects--it's very open-ended and about your own experiences. You can even bring a dictionary or just ask her for a word if you need it. I'm pretty sure everyone got at least 9/10 on all of them without any prep so don't worry. Plus the in-class essays aren't worth very much anyway. Put your effort into the take-home essays. They're worth 25% of your grade and there are three of them but the first two are only one page and the last one is two to three pages on a short story we read in class (which you can easily find in English btw). Basically just spend a few hours the day before writing and editing it. Remember that this is worth the most so actually try on it and flake on the other stuff. She really likes it if you use the grammar she teaches in class. Show off what you know and reap the points my friends. The final is super easy and should be given zero thought unless your grade is borderline. It's only worth 5% and she gives you the questions ahead of time and lets you practice in class. Oh and it will look like there's a lot of online homework, but it's not that bad and is only due every couple weeks. You get unlimited tries, so if you don't get 100% in the homework category you're only hurting yourself, especially since it's 20% of your grade.

      "Span 301 with Anderson Cain was an OK class. Although the course is supposed to make you a better writer, I don't think she taught us how to write better. Every lecture consisted of answering questions about the reading which was entailed all of Spanish and Latin American history. We would do the reading as we went in class as we filled out the answersto her worksheets. She is super easy to please participation wise. Just raise your hand and say something, it doesn't have to be all that intelligent. You don't have to do the readings to get by in class. Overall I like her as a person and liked how easy the class was. It didn't improve my Spanish very much though. It was basically an easy A with not much enrichment. She made us write small one pagers each week and then half way into the quarter we started to work on an 8 page essay that was due at the end of the quarter. You can write about any topic within Spanish and Latin American history ad she is a very nice grader. She would help correct grammar throughout your whole paper which was great!

Im not stupid, and this 100 level class is the hardest, most pointless class I have ever taken. Also, instead of being out to help and promote learning, she designs her test to be AS TRICKY as possible, and she includes no curve. The shame is she is a really nice, outgoing lady, but her understanding of the material is so vast, it is far too easy to become overwhelmed, especially with the fast pace. I would really say, from student to fellow student, do not, under any circumstances take this class unless it is your last viable alternative.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

In this class I failed the midterm because I did not finish the exam (the majority of the class could not finish as well). A few students who were exceptional finished, but not the majority of us. I studied for hours and hours before the final and managed to get an 84% on the final and save my grade in the class. Beware because the midterm is worth about 25% of your grade--so if you fail it your grade for the class is ruined. I got B's on the essays--that's the only reason I managed to get a C+ in the class after failing the midterm. Many other students got D's and C's on their essays. I took this class almost a year ago but it was SO bad that I'm putting in the effort to warn others.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

If you aren't good at essays, it's a tossup. Both midterms are essay exams, where you choose two of four prompts to write on. There is also a persuasive paper which is worth a lot of points.

      "This is my first polyrating ever but I think Professor Andes deserves it. Very possibly one of the best professors I've had at Poly. She is loud, funny, and very engaging. The class itself is a little tricky, as I imagine most Phil classes for non Phil majors are. She lectures each class session and there is a short answer (usually 2 question) in class quiz once a week (the following week you can make up half the points lost on the previous quiz by taking it home and writing the right answers). Andes is a brilliant lady and her enthusiasm for her teaching and the curriculum is very apparent. I went into her office hours once a week (sometimes just to talk) and they were extremely helpful. In her OH she goes over each student's individual questions one by one; very helpful in a philosophy course. Some possible downsides to Andes 230 class is that some material is presented quickly which makes it hard to take notes, but usually she is great at writing on the board the important information. She reviews the previous lecture's notes before each quiz, and also has great review sessions before the in class essays and final. I walked into the first day planning on dropping the course and walked out stoked for the next lecture. If you have the opportunity, I'd strongly recommend Laura Andes for Phil 230</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS. But if you have to take it, use CR/NC! Andes grades EXTREMELY hard. She kept telling the class how disappointed she was at our quiz grades, essay scores, etc etc because they were so low. Well.....WHOSE FAULT IS THAT. She expects you to become an amazing philosopher over a course of a quarter and grades like that too. Prepare to study HARD for this class. She really knows her stuff. But she is the most horrible teacher I have had at Cal Poly. In my opinion, she needs to stop piling on so much work and cater the class towards students expectations/needs and most importantly, UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A GE FOR MOST STUDENTS AND WE DO NOT WANNA GROW UP TO BE PHILOSOPHERS THANK YOU. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

If you don't understand something, but you ask immediately, she'll clear it up for you no problem.  However, if you wait a day or two, she's not as forgiving when asked questions.  She uses unique examples that are often easy to remember and relate to the topics, but she also tends to go at breakneck speeds. Honestly, I would suggest taking the class CR/NC, as it makes it much more enjoyable and less stressful overall.  Also, USE THE COURSE OUTLINE SHE GIVES YOU FOR YOUR NOTES. A lot of people didn't do this and had quite some issues organizing the information presented.  I used the outline and was mostly able to keep up and follow along, which really helped organize the thoughts she spouted and separate all the different point.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

You will regret ever meeting this person. She is one of those people that you just shake your head at and ignore most of the time because it is not worth wasting your voice talking to this imbecile. I almost feel sorry for her. Almost. She was constantly rude and racist in discussions, would put students down for asking questions, and lacked any structure in her grading techniques. I didn't learn a single thing from her class. It was basically hell. I hope she gets fired very soon. Laura Andes has the potential to destroy the strong reputation that Cal Poly has. I know she reads these reviews........ So, I have a message for you Laura Andes. Quit your job! You are extremely incompetent and should not be employed! Find a new profession! You are embarrassing yourself, your family, your last name, and your heritage by trying to teach. Do you think students just come on this website to write negative reviews? I strongly suggest you take a look at other professor's pages and you will see that there are many positive reviews.

      "Not going to lie, the class was somewhat difficult. The first midterm was hard, but only because it wasn't what I was expecting so I didn't study hard enough. After that, the second midterm and the final were much easier after I understood her testing format. You basically need to memorize all of the information she gives you, like word-for-word. It sounds tough, but it's honestly not that bad if you study enough. The reading can be dense, but you don't really need to read anything until the final comes around, for which there is a passage identification part. Make absolutely sure you attend every lecture, because all the information you need comes from those lectures. There are no PowerPoint slides or notes she uploads anywhere, so everything you learn is based on what she gives you. Overall, though, she was a genuinely nice teacher who tried her best to make the class interesting and keep students awake. Her teaching method is also very organized and makes the class easier to understand. Just don't underestimate the first midterm, memorize as much as you can, and it'll be easier. Go to her office hours and ask questions. I know it sounds tough now, but she's really not that bad and I also didn't take the class credit/no credit. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

She warns you starting out the class that she will be loud and rude, but I did not know the extent of what she meant.  I myself do not  take offense to things often, but she offended me in the first three weeks of class.  She would make strange comments, like when she talked about how \"everyone has an uncle that touches them inappropriately,\" laughing it off, and calling it \"drama\". Her test styles are erratic, and her lectures match it. There is literally no organization at all with this woman, so beware when you take this class that you will not be able to follow the psychotic ramblings  that she calls teaching.  She gives 50 minutes for 3 to 4 essays where she expects each one to be three pages or longer for the midterm. This class is a GPA killer, for GE class she expects you to take way too much time at home and practically ruins philosophy for anyone who will ever take it.

      "          I absolutely loved Laura Andes! She has got to be one of the best professors I have ever had. Every Tuesday and Thursday I looked forward to her class after my 8 consecutive hours of lab. She knows how to keep you engaged in the material, and make you laugh at the same time. Although Laura is a great professor, her class is inherently challenging. But, no one ever said college was easy. Especially when learning about the sources of knowledge. So, your final grade is not free.\r\n",
      "          Laura does not assign homework except some reading, and a quarterly project. Her tests are only difficult if you didn't attend lecture, and gave no effort to learning and contemplating the material. The exams are daunting at first, but eventually you realize that 65 minutes is more than enough time. She only cares that you can prove you understand the material and can express it accurately in a essay. She doesn't care if you are a good writer. Personally I suck at timed writing, but I did well on all the exams. \r\n",
      "          This is a class that requires you to seriously contemplate the material. And, most of the difficulty, in my opinion, comes from whether or not you are willing to digest and think critically about different ways of viewing reality and knowledge. Laura can't teach you your own views. However, she can help you along. \r\n",
      "          Overall, she grades fairly, lectures engagingly, and makes herself available in office hours (EVERYDAY). If you are unwilling to attend lecture, take advantage of her help, or put effort into the class material, then take a different GE and go waste someone else's time. \r\n",

      "So this class was very different than what I was expecting from a philosophy class. I felt that it was more straight forward and memorization based than I expected. If you are an organised person I would definitely recommend taking Ms. Andes class. Ms. Andes has ridiculously clear expectations and she gives a thorough course outline of every lecture for the whole quarter. If you make good use of office hours and show  that you are being thoughtful in writing your mock exams (worth 40% of your grade) Ms. Andes will give you more than enough help. There are no surprises in this class and if you take the time to deeply consider the material, which is not necessarily necessary to do well grade wise (in my opinion), you will probably have some fun and become a more interesting person. There were several weeks where I did not do any work outside of going to lecture and taking good notes; I did well by studying a lot for the exams. Don’t panic about the passage ID; Ms. Andes picks sections that are representative of the main concepts of the chapter they are from. </div></div></div><br/>\n",

I have had to give her class higher priority than my major courses just because of the insane amount of time and work she demands. Her lectures are borderline nonsensical and don't help you with the tests at all. The degree of severity to which she grades her papers is absolutely unfair for students who might be taking a philosophy course for the first time. Worst of all she's biased in her grading. You can see a noticeable favoritism towards students that are more interactive with her during her lectures which hurts students like me who are frantically flipping through our notes just trying to figure out what she's talking about. I could not give her a lower recommendation or have had more disdain for a teacher/teaching style in my life.

Just respect the class like you would respect any other class and you will do fine. The problem is people want to take \"an easy A\" GE and not have to work for an A. We are in college everyone, take education seriously, why are you here if not to learn? If you've read the course description, and are curious - please take with Ms. Andes! I had a friend in the same PHIL 230 with another prof, and she was bored out of her mind for the 2 hours.I looked forward to lecture, I would have taken more courses with her if it wasn't my last quarter. Just be cool - she really does like everyone, gives people the benefit of the doubt, 2nd and 3rd chances, constantly gave out extra credit... so on. She is an all in teacher - we need more profs like her at Cal Poly, you can tell she gives 110%. When she graded my work, she went so in depth on how to improve my writing - a teacher who thoughtfully grades EVERYONES work on time, amazing, she is the coolest.

      "First things first, she is loud!!! she is not afraid to yell at the top of her lungs in class. her lecture style can be a bit scattered but she reviews in the first 15-30 min of class, that is probably the most crucial parts of class. the essays arent too hard if you study, but she is a super harsh grader on them. the grading system is what saves you in the class! there are 6 areas to receive a grade and she only takes the best 5! I think I also did so well in the class because I met with a private tutor once a week. But study hard and you can do well. Any Phil class sucks so maybe take the class as CR/NCR.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "Although Laura Andes was a decent professor and had a good personality, she was completely insensitive to student issues. Her midterms and finals were ridiculously hard (asking the student to complete a 1500 word essay in 60 minutes). Laura thought she was all knowing in her area and thus very rarely allowed the student to have an opinion. She acted as if her class was the only class you were taking and takes pride in the fact that her average grade is a C-. The class was interesting but I would definitely take it credit/no credit to take the stress away from doing well on the impossible exams.</div></div></div><br/>\n",

      "I should have listened to the polyratings. Even though I am taking this class CR/NC, I am actually still worried about receiving credit... which is ridiculous. I don't even know where to begin with her....\r\n",
      "She expects you to memorize her lecture notes word for word, and if you try to say something in your own words on her quizzes, she takes off like 10 points. She reviews during the first 20 minutes or so during class but it's scary as hell because she just completely nails you if you don't say the right example that she wants. Um.. TAKES ATTENDANCE FOR NO FUCKING REASON. Really.. I thought it would count for part of our grade, but no.. On the syllabus it explicitly says she won't count participation.. the why the HELL do you take attendance?! \r\n",
      "Sorry if Phi 231 is a GE and no one gives a flying fuck about philosophy.. I was hoping to become enlightened after taking this class, but no, I'm stuck here trying to memorize chapter titles of a stupid book.

      "All you have to do to succeed in this class is show up, take good notes and study for the midterms and final. You don't really have to do the readings or anything else as long as you pay attention in class. She gives you all the information you need to know before the tests so you basically just have to memorize, which is not that hard. People need to understand that Philosophy isn't for everyone, some people are interested in it, some aren't. Andes is a great professor, the people complaining on here most likely just don't find philosophy interesting. I took this as a GE and enjoyed it, god forbid I had to put in some effort.</div></div></div><br/>\n",
